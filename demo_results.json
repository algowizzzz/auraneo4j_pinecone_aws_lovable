        "text": "General  Commerce Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, was incorporated under the laws of Missouri on August 4, 1966. Through a second tier wholly-owned bank holding company, it owns all the outstanding capital stock of Commerce Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), which is headquartered in Missouri. The Bank engages in general banking business, providing a broad range of retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to individuals and businesses. Commerce Bancshares, Inc. also owns, directly or through the Bank, various non-banking subsidiaries. Their activities include private equity investment, securities brokerage, insurance agency, specialty lending, and leasing activities. A list of Commerce Bancshares, Inc.'s subsidiaries is included as Exhibit 21.  Commerce Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\") is one of the nation\u2019s top 50 bank holding companies, based on asset size. At December\u00a031, 2020, the Company had consolidated assets of $32.9 billion, loans of $16.4 billion, deposits of $26.9 billion, and equity of $3.4 billion. The Company\u2019s operations are consolidated for purposes of preparing the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The Company's principal markets, which are served by 157 branch facilities, are located throughout Missouri, Kansas, and central Illinois, as well as Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado. Its two largest markets are St. Louis and Kansas City, which serve as central hubs for the Company. The Company also has offices supporting its commercial customers in Dallas, Houston, Cincinnati, Nashville, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids, and operates a commercial payments business with sales representatives covering the continental United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d).  The Company\u2019s goal is to be the preferred provider of financial services in its communities, based on strong customer relationships built through providing top quality service with a strong risk management culture, and employing a strong balance sheet with strong capital levels. The Company operates under a super-community banking format which incorporates large bank product offerings coupled with deep local market knowledge, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select, critical areas. The Company\u2019s focus on local markets is supported by an experienced team of bankers assigned to each market coupled with industry specialists. The Company also uses regional advisory boards, comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives, who assist the Company in responding to local banking needs. In addition to this local market, community-based focus, the Company offers sophisticated financial products usually only available at much larger financial institutions.  The markets the Bank serves are mainly located in the lower Midwest, which provides natural sites for production and distribution facilities and serve as transportation hubs. The economy has been well-diversified in these markets with many major industries represented, including telecommunications, automobile, technology, financial services, aircraft and general manufacturing, health care, numerous service industries, and food and agricultural production. The personal real estate lending operations of the Bank are predominantly centered in its lower Midwestern markets.  From time to time, the Company evaluates the potential acquisition of various financial institutions. In addition, the Company regularly considers the purchase and disposition of real estate assets and branch locations. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and either possess significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company has not completed any bank acquisitions since 2013.  Employees and Human Capital  The Company employed 4,404 persons on a full-time basis and 184 persons on a part-time basis at December\u00a031, 2020. None of the Company's employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  Attracting and retaining talented team members is key to the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy and compete effectively. The Company values the unique combination of talents and experiences each team member contributes toward the Company\u2019s success and strives to offer rewards that meet team members\u2019 individual, evolving needs. Well-being is much more than a paycheck and that\u2019s why the Company takes a comprehensive approach to Total Rewards, supporting team members\u2019 physical well-being, financial well-being, and emotional well-being and career development. The Company\u2019s financial well-being program includes a company-matching 401(k) plan and health savings accounts, educational and adoption assistance programs. Emotional well-being programs include paid time off, an employee assistance program (EAP) and company-paid membership to Care.com. Physical well-being is supported by the Company\u2019s health, dental, vision, life and various other insurances, and a wellness program that incentivizes team members to live a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Career development is also a key component of the Company\u2019s Total Rewards, and the Company has a variety of programs to support team  3  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  members as they continue to grow within their current role or develop for their next role. Job shadowing, leadership development programs, Aspiring Managers program, Managing at Commerce, competency assessments and education assistance are just a few of the ways the Company helps team members excel.  During 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created new challenges for the Company and for its team members. The Company focused efforts on providing team members support and resources to navigate the unprecedented environment. Initiatives included daily communications providing relevant updates and information, resources for leaders to help keep their teams engaged and connected, new resources for working parents, and access to emotional support resources. The Company also provided premium pay to team members who were required to work onsite and 5 additional paid days off to team members experiencing COVID-19 related issues.  The Company believes diversity, equity, and inclusion builds stronger companies with better results. In 2020, the Company formalized and extended its commitment to focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by elevating initiatives in this area as strategic priorities, also known as \u201cblue chips\". The Company\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion focuses on four core pillars \u2013 people, customers, vendors, and community \u2013 while building on the foundation it has already established. The Company has launched a variety of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to support its diverse workforce. RISE (empowering women), EMERGE (connecting young professionals), VIBE (valuing multicultural perspectives), and PRIDE (engaging the LGBTQIA+ community) are important forums that provide team members opportunities to connect, learn, and encourage diverse perspectives. Other internal DEI efforts have included unconscious bias training, book clubs, listen, talk, and learn sessions, courageous conversation training, mentoring programs, and review of talent at all levels of the organization. The Company\u2019s longstanding approach of \u201cdoing what\u2019s right\u201d continues to guide its focus on its team members and communities.  The Company\u2019s robust listening strategy allows it to stay connected to the team member experience to understand the evolving needs of its team members and to focus on what matters most to them. This strategy includes a balance of surveys, focus groups, and one on one conversations to allow for two-way conversation and provides trends over time by key demographics. The Company\u2019s goal is to create a sense of belonging which it believes is connected to high levels of engagement, enablement, retention, and results. The Company\u2019s intentional strategy has allowed it to maintain levels of engagement that have been recognized by its annual survey partner, Korn Ferry, for being \u201cbest-in-class\u201d.  Competition  The Company operates in the highly competitive environment of financial services. The Company regularly faces competition from banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, credit card companies, private equity firms, leasing companies, securities brokers and dealers, financial technology companies, e-commerce companies, mutual fund companies, and other companies providing financial services. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Some other competitors are significantly larger than the Company, and therefore have greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, higher lending limits, and may offer products and services that the Company does not provide. The Company competes by providing a broad offering of products and services to support the needs of customers, matched with a strong commitment to customer service. The Company also competes based on quality, innovation, convenience, reputation, industry knowledge, and price. In its two largest markets, the Company has approximately 12% of the deposit market share in Kansas City and approximately 8% of the deposit market share in St. Louis.  Operating Segments  The Company is managed in three operating segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Wealth. The Commercial segment provides a full array of corporate lending, merchant and commercial bank card products, payment solutions, leasing, and international services, as well as business and government deposit, investment, and cash management services. The Consumer segment includes the retail branch network, consumer installment lending, personal mortgage banking, and consumer debit and credit bank card activities. The Wealth segment provides traditional trust and estate planning services, brokerage services, and advisory and discretionary investment portfolio management services to both personal and institutional corporate customers. In 2020, the Commercial, Consumer and Wealth segments contributed 52%, 25% and 22% of total segment pre-tax income, respectively. See the section captioned \"Operating Segments\" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this report and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on operating segments.  Government Policies  The Company's operations are affected by federal and state legislative changes, by the United States government, and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the numerous states in which they operate. These include, for example, the statutory minimum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal  4  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  Reserve System, United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary policies, the U.S. Patriot Act, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state bank regulatory agencies.  Supervision and Regulation  The following information summarizes existing laws and regulations that materially affect the Company's operations. It does not discuss all provisions of these laws and regulations, and it does not include all laws and regulations that affect the Company presently or may affect the Company in the future.  General  The Company, as a bank holding company, is primarily regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s prior approval is required in any case in which the Company proposes to acquire all or substantially all the assets of any bank, acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. With certain exceptions, the BHC Act also prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any non-banking company. Under the BHC Act, the Company may not engage in any business other than managing and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services to subsidiaries, and may not acquire voting control of non-banking companies unless the Federal Reserve Board determines such businesses and services to be closely related to banking. When reviewing bank acquisition applications for approval, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA). Under the terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income areas. The Bank has a current CRA rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d  The Company is required to file various reports and additional information with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regularly performs examinations of the Company. The Bank is a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Missouri Division of Finance. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In addition, there are numerous other federal and state laws and regulations which control the activities of the Company, including requirements and limitations relating to capital and reserve requirements, permissible investments and lines of business, transactions with affiliates, loan limits, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of securities, dividend payments, and extensions of credit. The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws designed to protect customers and promote fair lending. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts. If the Company fails to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, it may be subject to civil monetary penalties, imposition of cease and desist orders or other written directives, removal of management and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the preservation of the federal deposit insurance funds. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company\u2019s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to employ assets and maximize income.  In addition to its regulatory powers, the Federal Reserve Bank affects the conditions under which the Company operates by its influence over the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. government securities and oversees changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, changes in the federal funds rate on overnight inter-bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits in implementing its monetary policy objectives. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits, the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and the level of inflation. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions, most notably on the interest rate environment. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company makes no prediction as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand, or their effect on the financial statements of the Company.  The financial industry operates under laws and regulations that are under regular review by various agencies and legislatures and are subject to change. The Company currently operates as a bank holding company, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and the Bank qualifies as a financial subsidiary under the GLB Act, which allows it to engage in investment banking, insurance agency, brokerage, and underwriting activities that were not available to banks prior to the GLB Act. The GLB Act also included privacy provisions that limit banks\u2019 abilities to disclose non-public information about customers to non-affiliated entities.  5  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  The Company must also comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA is designed to help fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes. Compliance is monitored by the Federal Reserve. The BSA was enacted to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries for, or to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from, criminal activity. Since its passage, the BSA has been amended several times. These amendments include the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 which made money laundering a criminal act, as well as the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 which required regulators to develop enhanced examination procedures and increased examiner training to improve the identification of money laundering schemes in financial institutions.  The USA PATRIOT Act, established in 2001, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations include significant penalties for non-compliance.  The Company is subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 (Dodd-Frank Act). Among its many provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act required stress-testing for certain financial services companies and established a new council of \u201csystemic risk\u201d regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which is authorized to supervise certain financial services companies and has responsibility to implement, examine for compliance with, and enforce \u201cFederal consumer financial law.\u201d The Company is subject to examinations by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act, through Title VI, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, placed trading restrictions on financial institutions and separated investment banking, private equity and proprietary trading (hedge fund) sections of financial institutions from their consumer lending arms. The Volcker Rule also restricts financial institutions from investing in and sponsoring certain types of investments.  In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law which provides a number of limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Notable provisions of the legislation include: an increase in the asset threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion, above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards; an exemption from the Volcker Rule for insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets; modifications to the Liquidity Coverage and Supplementary Leverage ratios; and the elimination of Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests for banks and bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets. Most of these provisions affect institutions larger than the Company, and the Company is not required to prepare stress testing as specified by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Subsidiary Bank  Under Federal Reserve policy, the bank holding company, Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (the \"Parent\"), is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support it in circumstances when it might not otherwise do so. In addition, loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  Deposit Insurance  Substantially all of the deposits held by the Bank are insured up to applicable limits (generally $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category) by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.\u00a0In 2011, the FDIC released a final rule to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that affected deposit insurance assessments.\u00a0Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, removed the upper limit of the designated reserve ratio, required that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and required the FDIC to offset the effect of increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio on depository institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion.\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act provided the FDIC flexibility in the implementation of the increase in the designated reserve ratio and also required that the FDIC redefine the assessment base to average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity.  On June 30, 2016, the DIF rose above 1.15%, resulting in a reduction of the initial assessment rate for all banks and implementing a 4.5 basis point surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Effective October 1, 2018, this surcharge was eliminated as the DIF reached its required level of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. This had the effect of reducing the Company\u2019s insurance costs by $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company's deposit insurance expense was $7.8 million and $6.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the  6  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  Company's 2020 deposit insurance expense was partly due to a higher assessment rate but was primarily driven by growth in the Company's assessment base.  Payment of Dividends  The Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of cash dividends to shareholders by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The principal source of the Parent's cash revenues is cash dividends paid by the Bank. The amount of dividends paid by the Bank in any calendar year is limited to the net profit of the current year combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, and permission must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board for dividends exceeding these amounts. The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by factors such as the maintenance of adequate capital.  Capital Adequacy  The Company is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to judgments by regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors.  A comprehensive capital framework was established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which was effective for large and internationally active U.S. banks and bank holding companies on January 1, 2015. A key goal of the Basel III framework was to strengthen the capital resources of banking organizations during normal and challenging business environments. Basel III increased minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The rule includes a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer is intended to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Failure to maintain the buffer will result in constraints on dividends, stock repurchases and executive compensation. The rule also adjusted the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. At December\u00a031, 2020, the Company's capital ratios are well in excess of those minimum ratios required by Basel III.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, an insured depository institution generally will be classified as well-capitalized (under the Basel III rules mentioned above) if it has a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d or \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. The Bank has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards.  Stress Testing  As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company performed stress tests as specified by the Federal Reserve requirement and published results beginning in 2014 through 2017. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was enacted, which eliminated the required stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act for banks with consolidated assets of less than $250 billion. The Company continues to perform periodic stress-testing based on its own internal criteria.  Executive and Incentive Compensation  Guidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice, and describe compensation as \"excessive\" when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. The Federal Reserve Board has issued comprehensive  7  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking. This guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, based on key principles that (i) incentives do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to identify and manage risk, (ii) compensation arrangements are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) compensation arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective board oversight. Deficiencies in compensation practices may affect supervisory ratings and enforcement actions may be taken if incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to safety and soundness.  Transactions with Affiliates  The Federal Reserve Board regulates transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries.\u00a0Generally, the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, limit the Company\u2019s banking subsidiary and its subsidiaries to lending and other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with affiliates.\u00a0The aggregate amount of covered transactions a banking subsidiary or its subsidiaries may enter into with an affiliate may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary.  Covered transactions with affiliates are also subject to collateralization requirements and must be conducted on arm\u2019s length terms.\u00a0Covered transactions include (a) a loan or extension of credit by the banking subsidiary, including derivative contracts, (b) a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary, (c) a purchase of assets by the banking subsidiary unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve, (d) acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan, and (e) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate.  Certain transactions with the Company's directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations. Among other things, these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals, and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans to related parties.

We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-  4  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  end 2022, served by 416 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2022.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For further information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d on page 38 in Management's Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  We focus on serving our customers and communities. Our experienced bankers develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  Some of the products and services we provide include:  \u2022Commercial and small business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses.

Additional offerings to our wealth management customers include:  \u25e6Investment management services  \u25e6Fiduciary and estate services  \u25e6Advanced business succession and estate planning services  5  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, and financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d). Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, mobile and online banking functionality and other delivery methods, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationship with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. In some cases, these regulations may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act, but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2022, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d), and in excess of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, compared with our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2022.  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 9.8 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.5 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.2 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 7.7 | |  |  Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test. Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require many banks to adhere to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) process and stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). We are not regulated by the FRB and therefore are not subject to this process. However, we use the FRB\u2019s CCAR process, including published economic scenarios, to inform our stress testing activities.  Liquidity  We manage liquidity in accordance with Basel III liquidity requirements, and we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. During the recent pandemic, our liquidity profile benefited from a significant influx of deposits, which was impacted by certain fiscal and monetary policy decisions. In 2022, with the withdrawal of such measures by the federal government, our deposit levels decreased; however, our liquidity profile remained above regulatory and internal Bank limits. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the rising interest rate environment.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  State regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. During the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators. For example, in 2022, the SEC proposed new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies. If the proposed rules are adopted, they may require changes in the way such companies disclose material cybersecurity events. These evolving laws and rules will continue to have an impact on our risk management practices.  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Other Regulations  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See discussion under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by ESG interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to ESG issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, our ongoing monitoring enables us to enhance our business practices by incorporating ESG recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities. In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s 2022 proposed rule on climate-related disclosures, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address ESG issues. These laws may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations and may increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address ESG issues. The report is available on our website.  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices. This system includes frameworks, policies, and guidelines such as the following:  \u2022Corporate Governance Guidelines;  \u2022A Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees;  \u2022A Director's Code of Conduct;  \u2022A Risk Management Framework;  \u2022A Related Party Transaction Policy;  \u2022A Compensation Clawback Policy;  \u2022Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines;  \u2022An Insider Trading Policy, including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders; and  \u2022Charters for our Executive, Audit, Risk Oversight, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.

We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.  The recent COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on how and where we work. We were successful in transitioning most of our employees to working remotely, and as the pandemic subsided and related treatments improved, we returned to more in-person collaboration while supporting certain flexible and remote work arrangements. We believe that in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture.  During 2022, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more options with health care plans, and greater access to mental health benefits.  We had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees December\u00a031, 2022. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our employees.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Schedule 2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | | | Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | Management | | | 52% | | |  | | | 28% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | Non-management | | | 61% | | |  | | | 39% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | Overall | | | 59% | | |  | | | 37% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | |  The following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:  Cultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate  We believe in an environment where people are respected and valued, and where individual and cultural differences are embraced. We also believe that our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  We have instituted enterprise-wide and affiliate diversity, equity, and inclusion councils; employee business forums; regional inclusion champions; mental health initiatives; and a broad range of employee and community events. Throughout the organization, employee business resource groups foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through forum meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity, both internally and externally.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  We offer more than 2,000 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2022, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the increasing competition for talent in the labor market. We experienced greater challenges in the recent past in filling certain job openings relative to when labor market conditions were more balanced, but we began to see improvement in 2022. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We value work-life balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental, physical, social, and financial wellness. Some of our key benefits include the following:  \u2022Corporate match for our 401(k) plan of 4.5% of an employee\u2019s salary and incentive compensation;  \u2022Annual profit-sharing contributions;  \u2022Health care plan options including behavioral health, wellness, and autism spectrum disorder services;  \u2022Expanded mental health coverage, including coaching and clinical therapy sessions;  \u2022Preventive prescription drug coverage not subject to deductibles;  \u2022Paid parental leave program;  \u2022Adoption assistance program; and  \u2022Paid time off for various community service activities and other volunteer opportunities.",

We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2023, served by 407 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For more information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) on page 42 and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  We focus on serving customers in the communities in which we operate. Our experienced bankers strive to develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Some of the products and services we provide, whether delivered digitally or by other means, include:  \u2022Commercial and small business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses. Products and services we provide to our commercial and small business banking customers include:  \u25e6Commercial and industrial and owner-occupied lending and leasing;  \u25e6Municipal and public finance services;  \u25e6Depository account and cash management services;  5  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u25e6Commercial and small business cards, as well as merchant processing services;  \u25e6Corporate trust services; and  \u25e6Correspondent banking and international lending services.  \u2022Capital markets and investment banking. We provide customized financing solutions to help our customers raise capital efficiently, execute strategic transactions, and manage exposure to financial markets. Capital markets products and services include:  \u25e6Loan syndications;  \u25e6Foreign exchange services and interest rate derivatives;  \u25e6Fixed income securities underwriting;  \u25e6Advisory and capital raising;  \u25e6Commercial mortgage-backed security (\u201cCMBS\u201d) conduit lending; and  \u25e6Power and project financing.  \u2022Commercial real estate lending. We provide lending products secured by commercial real estate to borrowers that include:  \u25e6Term and construction/land development financing, including the following collateral types:  \u25aaCommercial multi-family, industrial, and office; and  \u25aaResidential single-family, community development, and affordable housing.  \u2022Retail banking.

Additional offerings to our wealth management customers include:  \u25e6Investment management services;  \u25e6Fiduciary and estate services; and  \u25e6Advanced business succession and estate planning services.  COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.  During 2023, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more health care plan alternatives, and greater access to mental health benefits.  We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.

We are committed to continue this focus on ensuring that we have a workplace where all are treated fairly in accordance with their qualifications and abilities, and that the Bank is a place where everyone counts.  We strive to build a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structures. Our Everyone Counts Council coordinates the related efforts of our affiliates and enterprise groups, and advises executive management on goals and recommendations for ongoing improvement. Our efforts include employee business forums, mental health initiatives, and a broad range of employee and regional events. Throughout the organization, the employee business forums foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and connections to the communities in which we operate.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  Consistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for  13  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2023, served by 407 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For more information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) on page 42 and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our experienced bankers strive to develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Some of the products and services we provide, whether delivered digitally or by other means, include:  \u2022Commercial and small business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses. Products and services we provide to our commercial and small business banking customers include:  \u25e6Commercial and industrial and owner-occupied lending and leasing;  \u25e6Municipal and public finance services;  \u25e6Depository account and cash management services;  5  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u25e6Commercial and small business cards, as well as merchant processing services;  \u25e6Corporate trust services; and  \u25e6Correspondent banking and international lending services.  \u2022Capital markets and investment banking.

Additional offerings to our wealth management customers include:  \u25e6Investment management services;  \u25e6Fiduciary and estate services; and  \u25e6Advanced business succession and estate planning services.  COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment.

These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  We are proud of our employees who bring their unique, diverse talents to work each day. We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.  During 2023, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more health care plan alternatives, and greater access to mental health benefits.  We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.

We are committed to continue this focus on ensuring that we have a workplace where all are treated fairly in accordance with their qualifications and abilities, and that the Bank is a place where everyone counts.  We strive to build a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structures. Our Everyone Counts Council coordinates the related efforts of our affiliates and enterprise groups, and advises executive management on goals and recommendations for ongoing improvement. Our efforts include employee business forums, mental health initiatives, and a broad range of employee and regional events. Throughout the organization, the employee business forums foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and connections to the communities in which we operate.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  Consistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for  13  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2023, served by 407 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks.

COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

We are committed to continue this focus on ensuring that we have a workplace where all are treated fairly in accordance with their qualifications and abilities, and that the Bank is a place where everyone counts.  We strive to build a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structures. Our Everyone Counts Council coordinates the related efforts of our affiliates and enterprise groups, and advises executive management on goals and recommendations for ongoing improvement. Our efforts include employee business forums, mental health initiatives, and a broad range of employee and regional events. Throughout the organization, the employee business forums foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and connections to the communities in which we operate.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  Consistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups.

Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers.

Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.

We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups.

        "text": "Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation\u2019s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $170.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2020. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank\u2019s 1,073 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,386 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d section in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, securities lending, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services \u2014 both within and outside of our primary banking markets \u2014 through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp\u2019s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  We derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.  Demographics  In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our management structure and changed our basis of presentation into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.  The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital lending business by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs.  The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients  6  ---  in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance.

Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key\u2019s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  Human Capital  Engaging a diverse and talented team is a top strategic priority for Key. Our human capital management strategy includes recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent, rewarding and recognizing our employees based on performance, discouraging imprudent risk-taking, cultivating a fair and inclusive culture, and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. As part of our focus on balancing risk and reward, we carefully design our compensation programs to align with the guidance of our regulators and regularly monitor the programs to remain within our risk tolerances. All incentives paid to our employees are subject to a robust risk adjustment process that begins before grant and extends beyond payment.  Key had an average of 16,826 full time equivalent employees in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our employee count by region was approximately:  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Region | | | Employee Count | | | | New England Region | | | 417 | |  | | East Region | | | 2,479 | |  | | Upstate New York Region | | | 2,773 | |  | | Northeast Ohio/Western Pennsylvania Region | | | 6,128 | |  | | Great Lakes Region | | | 1,287 | |  | | Rocky Mountain Region | | | 1,182 | |  | | Pacific Region | | | 1,906 | |  | | Corporate Offices (Out of Footprint) | | | 1,613 | |  |  Key\u2019s purpose is to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive. We remain committed to attracting a talented and diverse workforce and supplier base that represents the clients and communities we serve. In 2020, we placed an emphasis on increasing minority representation in management and leadership roles, expanding our overall recruiting focus, developing diverse candidate slates and pipelines, increasing supplier diversity, and leveraging our existing employee resource groups to strengthen both engagement and inclusion.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, our overall workforce was 59% female, 79% White, 8% Black/African American, 6% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Asian and 2% other. Our Board of Directors is 47% diverse (5 women and 2 minorities out of 15 total Directors) and our Executive Leadership Team is 23% diverse (3 women out of 13 total executives).  For more information about our diversity and inclusion efforts, a more detailed breakdown of employee diversity by EEO-1 categories, and information about how we work every day and in every way to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive, please see our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.investor.key.com/esg-information/corporate-responsibility/.  8  ---  Information About Our Executive Officers  KeyCorp\u2019s executive officers are principally responsible for making policy for KeyCorp, subject to the supervision and direction of the Board.

Supervision and Regulation  The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers, the DIF, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit.  Overview  Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a \u201cbroker\u201d or a \u201cdealer\u201d in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation.  Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (\u201cFHC\u201d) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.  Under federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i)\u00a0identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii)\u00a0promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii)\u00a0respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  10  ---  As a FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December\u00a031, 2020, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory capital requirements  Background  KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.  The regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (\u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d). Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.  A capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis. Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2. A banking organization\u2019s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  The Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above. For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization\u2019s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.  Basel III  To address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers. The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period (\u201cRegulatory Capital Rules\u201d). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust  11  ---  preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp); establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as \u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations.  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December\u00a031, 2020, KeyCorp\u2019s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.  Minimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under  Regulatory Capital Rules  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Ratios (including stress capital buffer) | | | Regulatory Minimum Requirement | | | Stress Capital Buffer (b) | | | Regulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer | | | KeyCorp December 31, 2020 (c) | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 | | | 4.50 | | % | 2.50 | | % | 7.00 | | % | 9.73 | | % | | Tier 1 Capital | | | 6.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 8.50 | |  | 11.11 | |  | | Total Capital | | | 8.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 10.50 | |  | 13.40 | |  | | Leverage (a) | | | 4.00 | |  | N/A | | | 4.00 | |  | 8.94 | |  |  (a)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.  (b)Stress Capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.  (c)Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.  Revised prompt corrective action framework  The federal prompt corrective action framework established under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.  \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d and \u201cAdequately Capitalized\u201d Capital Category Ratios under  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Prompt Corrective Action | | |  | | | Capital Category | | | | | | | | | | Ratio | | |  | | | Well\u00a0Capitalized\u00a0(a) | | |  | | | Adequately\u00a0Capitalized | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 6.5 | | % |  | | | 4.5 | | % | | Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 8.0 | |  |  | | | 6.0 | |  | | Total Risk-Based | | |  | | | 10.0 | |  |  | | | 8.0 | |  | | Tier 1 Leverage (b) | | |  | | | 5.0 | |  |  | | | 4.0 | |  |  (a)A \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  (b)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January\u00a01, 2018.  We believe that, as of December\u00a031, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.  Recent regulatory capital-related developments  In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d) and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by: (1) enhancing the robustness and risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment, and operational risk; (2) constraining the use of internal models  12  ---  by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (used by advanced approaches banking organizations) and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and operational risk; (3) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically-important banks; and (4) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust, risk-sensitive floor based on the Basel III standardized approach.  The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee\u2019s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.  Subsequently, in December 2018, the Basel Committee released an update to its Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee\u2019s final revisions to Basel III. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017.  On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations, including Key. The final rule simplifies, for these banking organizations, the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25% deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250% risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. The final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the Regulatory Capital Rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule provided an effective date of October 1, 2019, for the technical amendments and an effective date of April 1, 2020, for the simplification changes. On November 13, 2019, the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either January 1, 2020, or April 1, 2020. We chose to implement the simplification changes on April 1, 2020.  In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the Regulatory Capital Rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate (\u201cHVCRE\u201d) exposure. HVCRE exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, conforms the HVCRE definition to statutory changes enacted in May 2018. The final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised HVCRE definition of credit facilities that finance one-to-four family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land.  A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years CECL\u2019s adverse effects on regulatory capital (\u201cCECL Interim Final Rule\u201d). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of  13  ---  regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL.  On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL\u2019s effects on regulatory capital.  Liquidity requirements  U.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee in 2010, and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 (as revised, the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d). The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.  To address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cBasel III LCR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (\u201cBasel III NSFR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cLiquidity Coverage Rules\u201d). Consistent with the Basel III LCR, the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Rules established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (\u201cModified LCR\u201d) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.  In December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the LCR and Modified LCR. Under the final rule, each calendar quarter KeyCorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its Modified LCR calculation, together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its Modified LCR. KeyCorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2018.  Large BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements (collectively, \u201cEPSs\u201d), including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  14  ---  EGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the EPS is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC\u2019s or BHCs\u2019 capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.  In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The final rules established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (\u201cCategory IV Firms\u201d). The Tailoring Rules became effective on December 31, 2019.  In one of the Tailoring Rules, the federal banking agencies amended various rules, including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements, thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this final rule, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a reduced LCR. KeyCorp believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced LCR. Thus, as of December 31, 2019, KeyCorp is no longer subject to an LCR requirement or an LCR public disclosure requirement.  In the other Tailoring Rule, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards (including liquidity standards) to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required, calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly, and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm\u2019s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.  On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions established by the Tailoring Rules. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.  Capital planning and stress testing  The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC\u2019s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.  The Federal Reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and  15  ---  severely adverse scenarios (and through 2018, an adverse scenario), that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank has only had to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. KeyCorp has been required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests have been disclosed under the \u201cRegulatory Disclosures & Filings\u201d section of the \u201cFinancials\u201d tab of Key\u2019s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir.  One of the Tailoring Rules issued by the Federal Reserve in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA changes the stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs that are Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp). Under this rule, Category IV Firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case. In 2020, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  A separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in October 2019 to implement a provision in EGRRCPA that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federally-regulated banks to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. Under this final rule, federally-regulated banks with total assets of less than $250 billion (like KeyBank) will no longer be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the \u201cadverse\u201d scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC\u2019s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.  On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules.  In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions.  Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the  16  ---  appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms were prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances.  On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp\u2019s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp\u2019s stress capital requirement of 2.5%.  On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it planned to release firm-specific results from the firms\u2019 performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020.  Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that, in the aggregate, capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios. However, the Federal Reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty, it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. The Federal Reserve said that these firms (including KeyCorp) (1) are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (2) are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that, in the aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021.  On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations.  Dividend restrictions  Federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank\u2019s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the  17  ---  payment would cause it to be less than \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. Large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the Federal Reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on these restrictions, please see the section above entitled \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing\u201d and for more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (\u201cRestrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities\u201d) in this report.  FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability  Deposit insurance and assessments  The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor\u2019s deposits is $250,000 per depository.  The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution\u2019s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank\u2019s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank\u2019s performance on the FDIC\u2019s \u201clarge and highly complex institution\u201d risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank\u2019s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank\u2019s failure.  In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank), to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution\u2019s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the bank\u2019s CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. On July 16, 2019, the FDIC approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule. Among other things, the amendments to this rule (i) provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than April 1, 2021, upon notification to the FDIC; (ii) clarify the certification requirement; (iii) revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis (where the bank\u2019s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds); and (iv) streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the FDIC.  Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution\u2019s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution\u2019s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.  18  ---  Receivership of certain SIFIs  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d (\u201cOLA\u201d) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI\u2019s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.  If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC\u2019s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors\u2019 claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC\u2019s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors\u2019 claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC\u2019s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.  In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI\u2019s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014.  Depositor preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution\u2019s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  Resolution plans  BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.  In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large BHCs. Under this final rule, BHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this final rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements.  19  ---  On April 16, 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions, including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas: (i) creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size, complexity, and other factors; (ii) revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions, including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions; (iii) improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the FDIC and institutions on resolution-related matters; and (iv) revision of the $50 billion asset threshold in the current rule. The FDIC indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements. Under each of these approaches, institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan. The FDIC would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions. Comments on this ANPR were due by June 21, 2019. Any changes to this rule will impact KeyBank. The FDIC extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed.  On January 19, 2021, the FDIC issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans. The FDIC said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues. The FDIC further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm.  Other Regulatory Developments  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA\u2019s requirements.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  Volcker Rule  The Volcker Rule implements Section\u00a0619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits \u201cbanking entities,\u201d such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as \u201ccovered funds\u201d) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.  The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis.  20  ---  Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April\u00a01, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July\u00a021, 2017, with respect to covered funds. In addition, on December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments (i.e., contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before May 1, 2010, to make an investment) in \u201cilliquid\u201d covered funds.  Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in Note 6 (\u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d) in Item\u00a08 of this report. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.  On October 8, 2019, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the Volcker Rule; (ii) modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions; (iii) adds additional proprietary trading exclusions; and (iv) tailors the rule\u2019s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm\u2019s trading assets and liabilities. Under the final rule, a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has \u201csignificant\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least $20 billion. A banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $20 billion is regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity\u2019s activities, size, scope, and complexity. A presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with \u201climited\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion. The final rule rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the compliance date was January 1, 2021. Key believes that it will be regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule. We do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on Key.  On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose EPSs upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.  The resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2019. In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test, early remediation, and SCCL requirements. However, when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012, it included only the stress test requirements and not the SCCL or early remediation requirements.  21  ---  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including: (i)\u00a0the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve\u2019s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (ii)\u00a0liquidity requirements; (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (iv)\u00a0a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, raised, from $50 billion to $250 billion, the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp). Also, this statute requires the Federal Reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion (like KeyCorp), and the requirement for a publicly traded BHC to have a risk committee continues to apply if a BHC has assets of at least $50 billion.  On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements for BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011.  In one of the Tailoring Rules issued in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp believes that it is a Category IV Firm, the least restrictive of these categories. The Tailoring Rules are discussed further under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d  Bank transactions with affiliates  Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank\u2019s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm\u2019s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank\u2019s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp\u2019s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i)\u00a0the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser; (ii)\u00a0credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions; and (iii)\u00a0transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July\u00a021, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.  Supervision and governance  On November 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, including BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (like KeyCorp) (\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), in order to align the Federal Reserve\u2019s rating system with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms. The LFI Rating System will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions  22  ---  and will assess an institution\u2019s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System will be rated using the following scale: Broadly Meets Expectations, Conditionally Meets Expectations, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Conditionally Meets Expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation. The Federal Reserve assigned initial ratings under the LFI Rating System in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee framework (excluding KeyCorp) and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system (including KeyCorp).  The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but related proposals: (i) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions; and (ii) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors (published by the Federal Reserve on August 3, 2017) identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution\u2019s governance and controls. The proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization\u2019s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors. In addition, the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letters that could be eliminated or revised. The Federal Reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until February 15, 2018.  On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final proposal related to the LFI Rating System - the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. This guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System, together with the above-mentioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s board of directors. In general, the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management, business line management, and the independent risk management and control function. The guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature, by appointing a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Audit Officer. Finally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management, internal controls, and internal audit, and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks. Comments on this proposal were due by March 15, 2018.  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (\u201cLMI\u201d) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions\u2019 safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.  On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency\u2019s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank\u2019s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds, benchmarks, and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023.  On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit  23  ---  access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due by February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations.  On November 24, 2020, the OCC requested public comment on an NPR setting forth the OCC\u2019s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank\u2019s performance under the general performance standards contained in the OCC\u2019s 2020 final CRA rule. The proposal also explains how the OCC would assess a significant decline in a bank\u2019s CRA activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums. Further, the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final CRA rule. Comments on the NPR are due by February 2, 2021. On December 15, 2020, the OCC published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the OCC would require banks subject to the CRA general performance standards to complete. The OCC said that it intends to use the bank-specific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the CRA rule. Comments on this notice are due by February 16, 2021.  Control standards  On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company\u2019s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (i) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies; and (ii) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. The final rule became effective September 30, 2020.  Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19  Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees.  During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers\u2019 needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Recent regulatory capital-related developments\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.  The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender.  24  ---  The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower\u2019s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time.  On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action.  The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks\u2019 deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules.  On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators,",

        "text": "Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation\u2019s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $170.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2020. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank\u2019s 1,073 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,386 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d section in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, securities lending, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services \u2014 both within and outside of our primary banking markets \u2014 through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp\u2019s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  We derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.  Demographics  In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our management structure and changed our basis of presentation into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.  The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital lending business by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs.  The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients  6  ---  in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance.

Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key\u2019s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  Human Capital  Engaging a diverse and talented team is a top strategic priority for Key. Our human capital management strategy includes recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent, rewarding and recognizing our employees based on performance, discouraging imprudent risk-taking, cultivating a fair and inclusive culture, and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. As part of our focus on balancing risk and reward, we carefully design our compensation programs to align with the guidance of our regulators and regularly monitor the programs to remain within our risk tolerances. All incentives paid to our employees are subject to a robust risk adjustment process that begins before grant and extends beyond payment.  Key had an average of 16,826 full time equivalent employees in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our employee count by region was approximately:  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Region | | | Employee Count | | | | New England Region | | | 417 | |  | | East Region | | | 2,479 | |  | | Upstate New York Region | | | 2,773 | |  | | Northeast Ohio/Western Pennsylvania Region | | | 6,128 | |  | | Great Lakes Region | | | 1,287 | |  | | Rocky Mountain Region | | | 1,182 | |  | | Pacific Region | | | 1,906 | |  | | Corporate Offices (Out of Footprint) | | | 1,613 | |  |  Key\u2019s purpose is to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive. We remain committed to attracting a talented and diverse workforce and supplier base that represents the clients and communities we serve. In 2020, we placed an emphasis on increasing minority representation in management and leadership roles, expanding our overall recruiting focus, developing diverse candidate slates and pipelines, increasing supplier diversity, and leveraging our existing employee resource groups to strengthen both engagement and inclusion.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, our overall workforce was 59% female, 79% White, 8% Black/African American, 6% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Asian and 2% other. Our Board of Directors is 47% diverse (5 women and 2 minorities out of 15 total Directors) and our Executive Leadership Team is 23% diverse (3 women out of 13 total executives).  For more information about our diversity and inclusion efforts, a more detailed breakdown of employee diversity by EEO-1 categories, and information about how we work every day and in every way to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive, please see our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.investor.key.com/esg-information/corporate-responsibility/.  8  ---  Information About Our Executive Officers  KeyCorp\u2019s executive officers are principally responsible for making policy for KeyCorp, subject to the supervision and direction of the Board.

Supervision and Regulation  The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers, the DIF, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit.  Overview  Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a \u201cbroker\u201d or a \u201cdealer\u201d in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation.  Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (\u201cFHC\u201d) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.  Under federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i)\u00a0identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii)\u00a0promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii)\u00a0respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  10  ---  As a FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December\u00a031, 2020, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory capital requirements  Background  KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.  The regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (\u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d). Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.  A capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis. Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2. A banking organization\u2019s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  The Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above. For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization\u2019s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.  Basel III  To address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers. The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period (\u201cRegulatory Capital Rules\u201d). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust  11  ---  preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp); establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as \u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations.  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December\u00a031, 2020, KeyCorp\u2019s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.  Minimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under  Regulatory Capital Rules  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Ratios (including stress capital buffer) | | | Regulatory Minimum Requirement | | | Stress Capital Buffer (b) | | | Regulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer | | | KeyCorp December 31, 2020 (c) | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 | | | 4.50 | | % | 2.50 | | % | 7.00 | | % | 9.73 | | % | | Tier 1 Capital | | | 6.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 8.50 | |  | 11.11 | |  | | Total Capital | | | 8.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 10.50 | |  | 13.40 | |  | | Leverage (a) | | | 4.00 | |  | N/A | | | 4.00 | |  | 8.94 | |  |  (a)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.  (b)Stress Capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.  (c)Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.  Revised prompt corrective action framework  The federal prompt corrective action framework established under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.  \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d and \u201cAdequately Capitalized\u201d Capital Category Ratios under  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Prompt Corrective Action | | |  | | | Capital Category | | | | | | | | | | Ratio | | |  | | | Well\u00a0Capitalized\u00a0(a) | | |  | | | Adequately\u00a0Capitalized | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 6.5 | | % |  | | | 4.5 | | % | | Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 8.0 | |  |  | | | 6.0 | |  | | Total Risk-Based | | |  | | | 10.0 | |  |  | | | 8.0 | |  | | Tier 1 Leverage (b) | | |  | | | 5.0 | |  |  | | | 4.0 | |  |  (a)A \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  (b)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January\u00a01, 2018.  We believe that, as of December\u00a031, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.  Recent regulatory capital-related developments  In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d) and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by: (1) enhancing the robustness and risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment, and operational risk; (2) constraining the use of internal models  12  ---  by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (used by advanced approaches banking organizations) and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and operational risk; (3) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically-important banks; and (4) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust, risk-sensitive floor based on the Basel III standardized approach.  The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee\u2019s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.  Subsequently, in December 2018, the Basel Committee released an update to its Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee\u2019s final revisions to Basel III. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017.  On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations, including Key. The final rule simplifies, for these banking organizations, the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25% deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250% risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. The final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the Regulatory Capital Rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule provided an effective date of October 1, 2019, for the technical amendments and an effective date of April 1, 2020, for the simplification changes. On November 13, 2019, the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either January 1, 2020, or April 1, 2020. We chose to implement the simplification changes on April 1, 2020.  In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the Regulatory Capital Rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate (\u201cHVCRE\u201d) exposure. HVCRE exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, conforms the HVCRE definition to statutory changes enacted in May 2018. The final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised HVCRE definition of credit facilities that finance one-to-four family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land.  A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years CECL\u2019s adverse effects on regulatory capital (\u201cCECL Interim Final Rule\u201d). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of  13  ---  regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL.  On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL\u2019s effects on regulatory capital.  Liquidity requirements  U.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee in 2010, and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 (as revised, the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d). The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.  To address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cBasel III LCR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (\u201cBasel III NSFR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cLiquidity Coverage Rules\u201d). Consistent with the Basel III LCR, the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Rules established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (\u201cModified LCR\u201d) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.  In December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the LCR and Modified LCR. Under the final rule, each calendar quarter KeyCorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its Modified LCR calculation, together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its Modified LCR. KeyCorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2018.  Large BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements (collectively, \u201cEPSs\u201d), including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  14  ---  EGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the EPS is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC\u2019s or BHCs\u2019 capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.  In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The final rules established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (\u201cCategory IV Firms\u201d). The Tailoring Rules became effective on December 31, 2019.  In one of the Tailoring Rules, the federal banking agencies amended various rules, including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements, thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this final rule, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a reduced LCR. KeyCorp believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced LCR. Thus, as of December 31, 2019, KeyCorp is no longer subject to an LCR requirement or an LCR public disclosure requirement.  In the other Tailoring Rule, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards (including liquidity standards) to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required, calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly, and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm\u2019s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.  On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions established by the Tailoring Rules. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.  Capital planning and stress testing  The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC\u2019s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.  The Federal Reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and  15  ---  severely adverse scenarios (and through 2018, an adverse scenario), that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank has only had to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. KeyCorp has been required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests have been disclosed under the \u201cRegulatory Disclosures & Filings\u201d section of the \u201cFinancials\u201d tab of Key\u2019s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir.  One of the Tailoring Rules issued by the Federal Reserve in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA changes the stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs that are Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp). Under this rule, Category IV Firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case. In 2020, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  A separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in October 2019 to implement a provision in EGRRCPA that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federally-regulated banks to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. Under this final rule, federally-regulated banks with total assets of less than $250 billion (like KeyBank) will no longer be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the \u201cadverse\u201d scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC\u2019s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.  On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules.  In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions.  Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the  16  ---  appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms were prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances.  On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp\u2019s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp\u2019s stress capital requirement of 2.5%.  On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it planned to release firm-specific results from the firms\u2019 performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020.  Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that, in the aggregate, capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios. However, the Federal Reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty, it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. The Federal Reserve said that these firms (including KeyCorp) (1) are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (2) are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that, in the aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021.  On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations.  Dividend restrictions  Federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank\u2019s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the  17  ---  payment would cause it to be less than \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. Large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the Federal Reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on these restrictions, please see the section above entitled \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing\u201d and for more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (\u201cRestrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities\u201d) in this report.  FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability  Deposit insurance and assessments  The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor\u2019s deposits is $250,000 per depository.  The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution\u2019s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank\u2019s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank\u2019s performance on the FDIC\u2019s \u201clarge and highly complex institution\u201d risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank\u2019s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank\u2019s failure.  In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank), to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution\u2019s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the bank\u2019s CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. On July 16, 2019, the FDIC approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule. Among other things, the amendments to this rule (i) provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than April 1, 2021, upon notification to the FDIC; (ii) clarify the certification requirement; (iii) revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis (where the bank\u2019s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds); and (iv) streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the FDIC.  Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution\u2019s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution\u2019s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.  18  ---  Receivership of certain SIFIs  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d (\u201cOLA\u201d) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI\u2019s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.  If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC\u2019s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors\u2019 claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC\u2019s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors\u2019 claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC\u2019s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.  In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI\u2019s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014.  Depositor preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution\u2019s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  Resolution plans  BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.  In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large BHCs. Under this final rule, BHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this final rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements.  19  ---  On April 16, 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions, including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas: (i) creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size, complexity, and other factors; (ii) revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions, including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions; (iii) improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the FDIC and institutions on resolution-related matters; and (iv) revision of the $50 billion asset threshold in the current rule. The FDIC indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements. Under each of these approaches, institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan. The FDIC would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions. Comments on this ANPR were due by June 21, 2019. Any changes to this rule will impact KeyBank. The FDIC extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed.  On January 19, 2021, the FDIC issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans. The FDIC said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues. The FDIC further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm.  Other Regulatory Developments  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA\u2019s requirements.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  Volcker Rule  The Volcker Rule implements Section\u00a0619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits \u201cbanking entities,\u201d such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as \u201ccovered funds\u201d) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.  The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis.  20  ---  Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April\u00a01, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July\u00a021, 2017, with respect to covered funds. In addition, on December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments (i.e., contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before May 1, 2010, to make an investment) in \u201cilliquid\u201d covered funds.  Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in Note 6 (\u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d) in Item\u00a08 of this report. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.  On October 8, 2019, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the Volcker Rule; (ii) modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions; (iii) adds additional proprietary trading exclusions; and (iv) tailors the rule\u2019s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm\u2019s trading assets and liabilities. Under the final rule, a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has \u201csignificant\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least $20 billion. A banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $20 billion is regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity\u2019s activities, size, scope, and complexity. A presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with \u201climited\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion. The final rule rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the compliance date was January 1, 2021. Key believes that it will be regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule. We do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on Key.  On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose EPSs upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.  The resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2019. In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test, early remediation, and SCCL requirements. However, when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012, it included only the stress test requirements and not the SCCL or early remediation requirements.  21  ---  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including: (i)\u00a0the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve\u2019s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (ii)\u00a0liquidity requirements; (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (iv)\u00a0a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, raised, from $50 billion to $250 billion, the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp). Also, this statute requires the Federal Reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion (like KeyCorp), and the requirement for a publicly traded BHC to have a risk committee continues to apply if a BHC has assets of at least $50 billion.  On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements for BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011.  In one of the Tailoring Rules issued in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp believes that it is a Category IV Firm, the least restrictive of these categories. The Tailoring Rules are discussed further under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d  Bank transactions with affiliates  Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank\u2019s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm\u2019s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank\u2019s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp\u2019s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i)\u00a0the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser; (ii)\u00a0credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions; and (iii)\u00a0transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July\u00a021, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.  Supervision and governance  On November 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, including BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (like KeyCorp) (\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), in order to align the Federal Reserve\u2019s rating system with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms. The LFI Rating System will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions  22  ---  and will assess an institution\u2019s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System will be rated using the following scale: Broadly Meets Expectations, Conditionally Meets Expectations, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Conditionally Meets Expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation. The Federal Reserve assigned initial ratings under the LFI Rating System in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee framework (excluding KeyCorp) and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system (including KeyCorp).  The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but related proposals: (i) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions; and (ii) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors (published by the Federal Reserve on August 3, 2017) identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution\u2019s governance and controls. The proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization\u2019s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors. In addition, the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letters that could be eliminated or revised. The Federal Reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until February 15, 2018.  On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final proposal related to the LFI Rating System - the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. This guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System, together with the above-mentioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s board of directors. In general, the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management, business line management, and the independent risk management and control function. The guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature, by appointing a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Audit Officer. Finally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management, internal controls, and internal audit, and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks. Comments on this proposal were due by March 15, 2018.  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (\u201cLMI\u201d) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions\u2019 safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.  On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency\u2019s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank\u2019s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds, benchmarks, and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023.  On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit  23  ---  access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due by February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations.  On November 24, 2020, the OCC requested public comment on an NPR setting forth the OCC\u2019s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank\u2019s performance under the general performance standards contained in the OCC\u2019s 2020 final CRA rule. The proposal also explains how the OCC would assess a significant decline in a bank\u2019s CRA activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums. Further, the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final CRA rule. Comments on the NPR are due by February 2, 2021. On December 15, 2020, the OCC published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the OCC would require banks subject to the CRA general performance standards to complete. The OCC said that it intends to use the bank-specific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the CRA rule. Comments on this notice are due by February 16, 2021.  Control standards  On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company\u2019s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (i) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies; and (ii) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. The final rule became effective September 30, 2020.  Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19  Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees.  During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers\u2019 needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Recent regulatory capital-related developments\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.  The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender.  24  ---  The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower\u2019s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time.  On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action.  The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks\u2019 deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules.  On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators,",

        "text": "Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation\u2019s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $170.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2020. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank\u2019s 1,073 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,386 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d section in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, securities lending, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services \u2014 both within and outside of our primary banking markets \u2014 through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp\u2019s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  We derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.  Demographics  In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our management structure and changed our basis of presentation into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.  The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital lending business by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs.  The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients  6  ---  in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance.

Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key\u2019s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  Human Capital  Engaging a diverse and talented team is a top strategic priority for Key. Our human capital management strategy includes recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent, rewarding and recognizing our employees based on performance, discouraging imprudent risk-taking, cultivating a fair and inclusive culture, and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. As part of our focus on balancing risk and reward, we carefully design our compensation programs to align with the guidance of our regulators and regularly monitor the programs to remain within our risk tolerances. All incentives paid to our employees are subject to a robust risk adjustment process that begins before grant and extends beyond payment.  Key had an average of 16,826 full time equivalent employees in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our employee count by region was approximately:  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Region | | | Employee Count | | | | New England Region | | | 417 | |  | | East Region | | | 2,479 | |  | | Upstate New York Region | | | 2,773 | |  | | Northeast Ohio/Western Pennsylvania Region | | | 6,128 | |  | | Great Lakes Region | | | 1,287 | |  | | Rocky Mountain Region | | | 1,182 | |  | | Pacific Region | | | 1,906 | |  | | Corporate Offices (Out of Footprint) | | | 1,613 | |  |  Key\u2019s purpose is to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive. We remain committed to attracting a talented and diverse workforce and supplier base that represents the clients and communities we serve. In 2020, we placed an emphasis on increasing minority representation in management and leadership roles, expanding our overall recruiting focus, developing diverse candidate slates and pipelines, increasing supplier diversity, and leveraging our existing employee resource groups to strengthen both engagement and inclusion.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, our overall workforce was 59% female, 79% White, 8% Black/African American, 6% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Asian and 2% other. Our Board of Directors is 47% diverse (5 women and 2 minorities out of 15 total Directors) and our Executive Leadership Team is 23% diverse (3 women out of 13 total executives).  For more information about our diversity and inclusion efforts, a more detailed breakdown of employee diversity by EEO-1 categories, and information about how we work every day and in every way to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive, please see our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.investor.key.com/esg-information/corporate-responsibility/.  8  ---  Information About Our Executive Officers  KeyCorp\u2019s executive officers are principally responsible for making policy for KeyCorp, subject to the supervision and direction of the Board.

Supervision and Regulation  The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers, the DIF, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit.  Overview  Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a \u201cbroker\u201d or a \u201cdealer\u201d in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation.  Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (\u201cFHC\u201d) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.  Under federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i)\u00a0identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii)\u00a0promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii)\u00a0respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  10  ---  As a FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December\u00a031, 2020, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory capital requirements  Background  KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.  The regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (\u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d). Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.  A capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis. Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2. A banking organization\u2019s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  The Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above. For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization\u2019s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.  Basel III  To address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers. The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period (\u201cRegulatory Capital Rules\u201d). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust  11  ---  preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp); establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as \u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations.  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December\u00a031, 2020, KeyCorp\u2019s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.  Minimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under  Regulatory Capital Rules  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Ratios (including stress capital buffer) | | | Regulatory Minimum Requirement | | | Stress Capital Buffer (b) | | | Regulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer | | | KeyCorp December 31, 2020 (c) | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 | | | 4.50 | | % | 2.50 | | % | 7.00 | | % | 9.73 | | % | | Tier 1 Capital | | | 6.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 8.50 | |  | 11.11 | |  | | Total Capital | | | 8.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 10.50 | |  | 13.40 | |  | | Leverage (a) | | | 4.00 | |  | N/A | | | 4.00 | |  | 8.94 | |  |  (a)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.  (b)Stress Capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.  (c)Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.  Revised prompt corrective action framework  The federal prompt corrective action framework established under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.  \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d and \u201cAdequately Capitalized\u201d Capital Category Ratios under  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Prompt Corrective Action | | |  | | | Capital Category | | | | | | | | | | Ratio | | |  | | | Well\u00a0Capitalized\u00a0(a) | | |  | | | Adequately\u00a0Capitalized | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 6.5 | | % |  | | | 4.5 | | % | | Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 8.0 | |  |  | | | 6.0 | |  | | Total Risk-Based | | |  | | | 10.0 | |  |  | | | 8.0 | |  | | Tier 1 Leverage (b) | | |  | | | 5.0 | |  |  | | | 4.0 | |  |  (a)A \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  (b)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January\u00a01, 2018.  We believe that, as of December\u00a031, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.  Recent regulatory capital-related developments  In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d) and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by: (1) enhancing the robustness and risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment, and operational risk; (2) constraining the use of internal models  12  ---  by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (used by advanced approaches banking organizations) and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and operational risk; (3) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically-important banks; and (4) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust, risk-sensitive floor based on the Basel III standardized approach.  The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee\u2019s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.  Subsequently, in December 2018, the Basel Committee released an update to its Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee\u2019s final revisions to Basel III. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017.  On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations, including Key. The final rule simplifies, for these banking organizations, the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25% deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250% risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. The final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the Regulatory Capital Rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule provided an effective date of October 1, 2019, for the technical amendments and an effective date of April 1, 2020, for the simplification changes. On November 13, 2019, the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either January 1, 2020, or April 1, 2020. We chose to implement the simplification changes on April 1, 2020.  In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the Regulatory Capital Rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate (\u201cHVCRE\u201d) exposure. HVCRE exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, conforms the HVCRE definition to statutory changes enacted in May 2018. The final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised HVCRE definition of credit facilities that finance one-to-four family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land.  A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years CECL\u2019s adverse effects on regulatory capital (\u201cCECL Interim Final Rule\u201d). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of  13  ---  regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL.  On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL\u2019s effects on regulatory capital.  Liquidity requirements  U.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee in 2010, and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 (as revised, the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d). The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.  To address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cBasel III LCR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (\u201cBasel III NSFR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cLiquidity Coverage Rules\u201d). Consistent with the Basel III LCR, the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Rules established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (\u201cModified LCR\u201d) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.  In December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the LCR and Modified LCR. Under the final rule, each calendar quarter KeyCorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its Modified LCR calculation, together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its Modified LCR. KeyCorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2018.  Large BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements (collectively, \u201cEPSs\u201d), including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  14  ---  EGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the EPS is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC\u2019s or BHCs\u2019 capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.  In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The final rules established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (\u201cCategory IV Firms\u201d). The Tailoring Rules became effective on December 31, 2019.  In one of the Tailoring Rules, the federal banking agencies amended various rules, including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements, thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this final rule, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a reduced LCR. KeyCorp believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced LCR. Thus, as of December 31, 2019, KeyCorp is no longer subject to an LCR requirement or an LCR public disclosure requirement.  In the other Tailoring Rule, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards (including liquidity standards) to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required, calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly, and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm\u2019s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.  On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions established by the Tailoring Rules. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.  Capital planning and stress testing  The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC\u2019s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.  The Federal Reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and  15  ---  severely adverse scenarios (and through 2018, an adverse scenario), that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank has only had to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. KeyCorp has been required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests have been disclosed under the \u201cRegulatory Disclosures & Filings\u201d section of the \u201cFinancials\u201d tab of Key\u2019s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir.  One of the Tailoring Rules issued by the Federal Reserve in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA changes the stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs that are Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp). Under this rule, Category IV Firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case. In 2020, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  A separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in October 2019 to implement a provision in EGRRCPA that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federally-regulated banks to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. Under this final rule, federally-regulated banks with total assets of less than $250 billion (like KeyBank) will no longer be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the \u201cadverse\u201d scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC\u2019s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.  On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules.  In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions.  Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the  16  ---  appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms were prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances.  On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp\u2019s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp\u2019s stress capital requirement of 2.5%.  On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it planned to release firm-specific results from the firms\u2019 performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020.  Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that, in the aggregate, capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios. However, the Federal Reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty, it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. The Federal Reserve said that these firms (including KeyCorp) (1) are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (2) are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that, in the aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021.  On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations.  Dividend restrictions  Federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank\u2019s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the  17  ---  payment would cause it to be less than \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. Large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the Federal Reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on these restrictions, please see the section above entitled \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing\u201d and for more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (\u201cRestrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities\u201d) in this report.  FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability  Deposit insurance and assessments  The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor\u2019s deposits is $250,000 per depository.  The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution\u2019s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank\u2019s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank\u2019s performance on the FDIC\u2019s \u201clarge and highly complex institution\u201d risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank\u2019s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank\u2019s failure.  In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank), to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution\u2019s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the bank\u2019s CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. On July 16, 2019, the FDIC approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule. Among other things, the amendments to this rule (i) provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than April 1, 2021, upon notification to the FDIC; (ii) clarify the certification requirement; (iii) revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis (where the bank\u2019s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds); and (iv) streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the FDIC.  Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution\u2019s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution\u2019s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.  18  ---  Receivership of certain SIFIs  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d (\u201cOLA\u201d) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI\u2019s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.  If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC\u2019s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors\u2019 claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC\u2019s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors\u2019 claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC\u2019s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.  In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI\u2019s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014.  Depositor preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution\u2019s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  Resolution plans  BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.  In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large BHCs. Under this final rule, BHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this final rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements.  19  ---  On April 16, 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions, including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas: (i) creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size, complexity, and other factors; (ii) revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions, including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions; (iii) improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the FDIC and institutions on resolution-related matters; and (iv) revision of the $50 billion asset threshold in the current rule. The FDIC indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements. Under each of these approaches, institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan. The FDIC would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions. Comments on this ANPR were due by June 21, 2019. Any changes to this rule will impact KeyBank. The FDIC extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed.  On January 19, 2021, the FDIC issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans. The FDIC said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues. The FDIC further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm.  Other Regulatory Developments  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA\u2019s requirements.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  Volcker Rule  The Volcker Rule implements Section\u00a0619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits \u201cbanking entities,\u201d such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as \u201ccovered funds\u201d) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.  The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis.  20  ---  Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April\u00a01, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July\u00a021, 2017, with respect to covered funds. In addition, on December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments (i.e., contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before May 1, 2010, to make an investment) in \u201cilliquid\u201d covered funds.  Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in Note 6 (\u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d) in Item\u00a08 of this report. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.  On October 8, 2019, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the Volcker Rule; (ii) modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions; (iii) adds additional proprietary trading exclusions; and (iv) tailors the rule\u2019s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm\u2019s trading assets and liabilities. Under the final rule, a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has \u201csignificant\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least $20 billion. A banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $20 billion is regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity\u2019s activities, size, scope, and complexity. A presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with \u201climited\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion. The final rule rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the compliance date was January 1, 2021. Key believes that it will be regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule. We do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on Key.  On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose EPSs upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.  The resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2019. In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test, early remediation, and SCCL requirements. However, when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012, it included only the stress test requirements and not the SCCL or early remediation requirements.  21  ---  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including: (i)\u00a0the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve\u2019s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (ii)\u00a0liquidity requirements; (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (iv)\u00a0a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, raised, from $50 billion to $250 billion, the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp). Also, this statute requires the Federal Reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion (like KeyCorp), and the requirement for a publicly traded BHC to have a risk committee continues to apply if a BHC has assets of at least $50 billion.  On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements for BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011.  In one of the Tailoring Rules issued in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp believes that it is a Category IV Firm, the least restrictive of these categories. The Tailoring Rules are discussed further under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d  Bank transactions with affiliates  Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank\u2019s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm\u2019s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank\u2019s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp\u2019s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i)\u00a0the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser; (ii)\u00a0credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions; and (iii)\u00a0transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July\u00a021, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.  Supervision and governance  On November 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, including BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (like KeyCorp) (\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), in order to align the Federal Reserve\u2019s rating system with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms. The LFI Rating System will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions  22  ---  and will assess an institution\u2019s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System will be rated using the following scale: Broadly Meets Expectations, Conditionally Meets Expectations, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Conditionally Meets Expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation. The Federal Reserve assigned initial ratings under the LFI Rating System in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee framework (excluding KeyCorp) and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system (including KeyCorp).  The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but related proposals: (i) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions; and (ii) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors (published by the Federal Reserve on August 3, 2017) identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution\u2019s governance and controls. The proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization\u2019s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors. In addition, the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letters that could be eliminated or revised. The Federal Reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until February 15, 2018.  On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final proposal related to the LFI Rating System - the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. This guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System, together with the above-mentioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s board of directors. In general, the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management, business line management, and the independent risk management and control function. The guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature, by appointing a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Audit Officer. Finally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management, internal controls, and internal audit, and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks. Comments on this proposal were due by March 15, 2018.  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (\u201cLMI\u201d) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions\u2019 safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.  On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency\u2019s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank\u2019s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds, benchmarks, and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023.  On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit  23  ---  access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due by February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations.  On November 24, 2020, the OCC requested public comment on an NPR setting forth the OCC\u2019s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank\u2019s performance under the general performance standards contained in the OCC\u2019s 2020 final CRA rule. The proposal also explains how the OCC would assess a significant decline in a bank\u2019s CRA activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums. Further, the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final CRA rule. Comments on the NPR are due by February 2, 2021. On December 15, 2020, the OCC published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the OCC would require banks subject to the CRA general performance standards to complete. The OCC said that it intends to use the bank-specific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the CRA rule. Comments on this notice are due by February 16, 2021.  Control standards  On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company\u2019s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (i) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies; and (ii) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. The final rule became effective September 30, 2020.  Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19  Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees.  During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers\u2019 needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Recent regulatory capital-related developments\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.  The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender.  24  ---  The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower\u2019s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time.  On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action.  The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks\u2019 deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules.  On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators,",

        "text": "Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation\u2019s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $170.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2020. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank\u2019s 1,073 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,386 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d section in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, securities lending, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services \u2014 both within and outside of our primary banking markets \u2014 through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp\u2019s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  We derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.  Demographics  In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our management structure and changed our basis of presentation into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.  The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital lending business by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs.  The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients  6  ---  in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance.

Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key\u2019s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  Human Capital  Engaging a diverse and talented team is a top strategic priority for Key. Our human capital management strategy includes recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent, rewarding and recognizing our employees based on performance, discouraging imprudent risk-taking, cultivating a fair and inclusive culture, and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. As part of our focus on balancing risk and reward, we carefully design our compensation programs to align with the guidance of our regulators and regularly monitor the programs to remain within our risk tolerances. All incentives paid to our employees are subject to a robust risk adjustment process that begins before grant and extends beyond payment.  Key had an average of 16,826 full time equivalent employees in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our employee count by region was approximately:  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Region | | | Employee Count | | | | New England Region | | | 417 | |  | | East Region | | | 2,479 | |  | | Upstate New York Region | | | 2,773 | |  | | Northeast Ohio/Western Pennsylvania Region | | | 6,128 | |  | | Great Lakes Region | | | 1,287 | |  | | Rocky Mountain Region | | | 1,182 | |  | | Pacific Region | | | 1,906 | |  | | Corporate Offices (Out of Footprint) | | | 1,613 | |  |  Key\u2019s purpose is to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive. We remain committed to attracting a talented and diverse workforce and supplier base that represents the clients and communities we serve. In 2020, we placed an emphasis on increasing minority representation in management and leadership roles, expanding our overall recruiting focus, developing diverse candidate slates and pipelines, increasing supplier diversity, and leveraging our existing employee resource groups to strengthen both engagement and inclusion.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, our overall workforce was 59% female, 79% White, 8% Black/African American, 6% Hispanic/Latino, 5% Asian and 2% other. Our Board of Directors is 47% diverse (5 women and 2 minorities out of 15 total Directors) and our Executive Leadership Team is 23% diverse (3 women out of 13 total executives).  For more information about our diversity and inclusion efforts, a more detailed breakdown of employee diversity by EEO-1 categories, and information about how we work every day and in every way to help our clients, colleagues, and communities thrive, please see our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.investor.key.com/esg-information/corporate-responsibility/.  8  ---  Information About Our Executive Officers  KeyCorp\u2019s executive officers are principally responsible for making policy for KeyCorp, subject to the supervision and direction of the Board.

Supervision and Regulation  The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers, the DIF, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit.  Overview  Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a \u201cbroker\u201d or a \u201cdealer\u201d in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation.  Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (\u201cFHC\u201d) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.  Under federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i)\u00a0identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii)\u00a0promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii)\u00a0respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  10  ---  As a FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December\u00a031, 2020, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory capital requirements  Background  KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.  The regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (\u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d). Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.  A capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis. Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2. A banking organization\u2019s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  The Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above. For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization\u2019s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.  Basel III  To address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers. The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period (\u201cRegulatory Capital Rules\u201d). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust  11  ---  preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp); establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as \u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations.  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December\u00a031, 2020, KeyCorp\u2019s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.  Minimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under  Regulatory Capital Rules  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Ratios (including stress capital buffer) | | | Regulatory Minimum Requirement | | | Stress Capital Buffer (b) | | | Regulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer | | | KeyCorp December 31, 2020 (c) | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 | | | 4.50 | | % | 2.50 | | % | 7.00 | | % | 9.73 | | % | | Tier 1 Capital | | | 6.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 8.50 | |  | 11.11 | |  | | Total Capital | | | 8.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 10.50 | |  | 13.40 | |  | | Leverage (a) | | | 4.00 | |  | N/A | | | 4.00 | |  | 8.94 | |  |  (a)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.  (b)Stress Capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.  (c)Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.  Revised prompt corrective action framework  The federal prompt corrective action framework established under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.  \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d and \u201cAdequately Capitalized\u201d Capital Category Ratios under  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Prompt Corrective Action | | |  | | | Capital Category | | | | | | | | | | Ratio | | |  | | | Well\u00a0Capitalized\u00a0(a) | | |  | | | Adequately\u00a0Capitalized | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 6.5 | | % |  | | | 4.5 | | % | | Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 8.0 | |  |  | | | 6.0 | |  | | Total Risk-Based | | |  | | | 10.0 | |  |  | | | 8.0 | |  | | Tier 1 Leverage (b) | | |  | | | 5.0 | |  |  | | | 4.0 | |  |  (a)A \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  (b)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January\u00a01, 2018.  We believe that, as of December\u00a031, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.  Recent regulatory capital-related developments  In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d) and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by: (1) enhancing the robustness and risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment, and operational risk; (2) constraining the use of internal models  12  ---  by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (used by advanced approaches banking organizations) and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and operational risk; (3) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically-important banks; and (4) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust, risk-sensitive floor based on the Basel III standardized approach.  The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee\u2019s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.  Subsequently, in December 2018, the Basel Committee released an update to its Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee\u2019s final revisions to Basel III. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017.  On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations, including Key. The final rule simplifies, for these banking organizations, the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25% deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250% risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. The final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the Regulatory Capital Rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule provided an effective date of October 1, 2019, for the technical amendments and an effective date of April 1, 2020, for the simplification changes. On November 13, 2019, the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either January 1, 2020, or April 1, 2020. We chose to implement the simplification changes on April 1, 2020.  In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the Regulatory Capital Rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate (\u201cHVCRE\u201d) exposure. HVCRE exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, conforms the HVCRE definition to statutory changes enacted in May 2018. The final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised HVCRE definition of credit facilities that finance one-to-four family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land.  A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years CECL\u2019s adverse effects on regulatory capital (\u201cCECL Interim Final Rule\u201d). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of  13  ---  regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL.  On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL\u2019s effects on regulatory capital.  Liquidity requirements  U.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee in 2010, and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 (as revised, the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d). The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.  To address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cBasel III LCR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (\u201cBasel III NSFR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cLiquidity Coverage Rules\u201d). Consistent with the Basel III LCR, the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Rules established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (\u201cModified LCR\u201d) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.  In December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the LCR and Modified LCR. Under the final rule, each calendar quarter KeyCorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its Modified LCR calculation, together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its Modified LCR. KeyCorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2018.  Large BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements (collectively, \u201cEPSs\u201d), including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  14  ---  EGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the EPS is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC\u2019s or BHCs\u2019 capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.  In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The final rules established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (\u201cCategory IV Firms\u201d). The Tailoring Rules became effective on December 31, 2019.  In one of the Tailoring Rules, the federal banking agencies amended various rules, including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements, thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this final rule, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a reduced LCR. KeyCorp believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced LCR. Thus, as of December 31, 2019, KeyCorp is no longer subject to an LCR requirement or an LCR public disclosure requirement.  In the other Tailoring Rule, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards (including liquidity standards) to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required, calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly, and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm\u2019s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.  On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions established by the Tailoring Rules. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.  Capital planning and stress testing  The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC\u2019s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.  The Federal Reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and  15  ---  severely adverse scenarios (and through 2018, an adverse scenario), that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank has only had to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. KeyCorp has been required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests have been disclosed under the \u201cRegulatory Disclosures & Filings\u201d section of the \u201cFinancials\u201d tab of Key\u2019s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir.  One of the Tailoring Rules issued by the Federal Reserve in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA changes the stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs that are Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp). Under this rule, Category IV Firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case. In 2020, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  A separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in October 2019 to implement a provision in EGRRCPA that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federally-regulated banks to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. Under this final rule, federally-regulated banks with total assets of less than $250 billion (like KeyBank) will no longer be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the \u201cadverse\u201d scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC\u2019s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.  On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules.  In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions.  Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the  16  ---  appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms were prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances.  On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp\u2019s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp\u2019s stress capital requirement of 2.5%.  On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it planned to release firm-specific results from the firms\u2019 performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020.  Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that, in the aggregate, capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios. However, the Federal Reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty, it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. The Federal Reserve said that these firms (including KeyCorp) (1) are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (2) are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that, in the aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021.  On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations.  Dividend restrictions  Federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank\u2019s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the  17  ---  payment would cause it to be less than \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. Large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the Federal Reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on these restrictions, please see the section above entitled \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing\u201d and for more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (\u201cRestrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities\u201d) in this report.  FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability  Deposit insurance and assessments  The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor\u2019s deposits is $250,000 per depository.  The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution\u2019s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank\u2019s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank\u2019s performance on the FDIC\u2019s \u201clarge and highly complex institution\u201d risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank\u2019s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank\u2019s failure.  In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank), to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution\u2019s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the bank\u2019s CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. On July 16, 2019, the FDIC approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule. Among other things, the amendments to this rule (i) provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than April 1, 2021, upon notification to the FDIC; (ii) clarify the certification requirement; (iii) revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis (where the bank\u2019s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds); and (iv) streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the FDIC.  Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution\u2019s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution\u2019s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.  18  ---  Receivership of certain SIFIs  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d (\u201cOLA\u201d) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI\u2019s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.  If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC\u2019s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors\u2019 claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC\u2019s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors\u2019 claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC\u2019s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.  In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI\u2019s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014.  Depositor preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution\u2019s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  Resolution plans  BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.  In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large BHCs. Under this final rule, BHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this final rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements.  19  ---  On April 16, 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions, including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas: (i) creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size, complexity, and other factors; (ii) revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions, including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions; (iii) improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the FDIC and institutions on resolution-related matters; and (iv) revision of the $50 billion asset threshold in the current rule. The FDIC indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements. Under each of these approaches, institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan. The FDIC would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions. Comments on this ANPR were due by June 21, 2019. Any changes to this rule will impact KeyBank. The FDIC extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed.  On January 19, 2021, the FDIC issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans. The FDIC said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues. The FDIC further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm.  Other Regulatory Developments  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA\u2019s requirements.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  Volcker Rule  The Volcker Rule implements Section\u00a0619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits \u201cbanking entities,\u201d such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as \u201ccovered funds\u201d) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.  The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis.  20  ---  Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April\u00a01, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July\u00a021, 2017, with respect to covered funds. In addition, on December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments (i.e., contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before May 1, 2010, to make an investment) in \u201cilliquid\u201d covered funds.  Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in Note 6 (\u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d) in Item\u00a08 of this report. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.  On October 8, 2019, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the Volcker Rule; (ii) modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions; (iii) adds additional proprietary trading exclusions; and (iv) tailors the rule\u2019s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm\u2019s trading assets and liabilities. Under the final rule, a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has \u201csignificant\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least $20 billion. A banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $20 billion is regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity\u2019s activities, size, scope, and complexity. A presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with \u201climited\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion. The final rule rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the compliance date was January 1, 2021. Key believes that it will be regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule. We do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on Key.  On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose EPSs upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.  The resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2019. In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test, early remediation, and SCCL requirements. However, when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012, it included only the stress test requirements and not the SCCL or early remediation requirements.  21  ---  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including: (i)\u00a0the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve\u2019s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (ii)\u00a0liquidity requirements; (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (iv)\u00a0a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, raised, from $50 billion to $250 billion, the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp). Also, this statute requires the Federal Reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion (like KeyCorp), and the requirement for a publicly traded BHC to have a risk committee continues to apply if a BHC has assets of at least $50 billion.  On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements for BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011.  In one of the Tailoring Rules issued in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp believes that it is a Category IV Firm, the least restrictive of these categories. The Tailoring Rules are discussed further under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d  Bank transactions with affiliates  Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank\u2019s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm\u2019s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank\u2019s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp\u2019s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i)\u00a0the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser; (ii)\u00a0credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions; and (iii)\u00a0transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July\u00a021, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.  Supervision and governance  On November 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, including BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (like KeyCorp) (\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), in order to align the Federal Reserve\u2019s rating system with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms. The LFI Rating System will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions  22  ---  and will assess an institution\u2019s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System will be rated using the following scale: Broadly Meets Expectations, Conditionally Meets Expectations, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Conditionally Meets Expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation. The Federal Reserve assigned initial ratings under the LFI Rating System in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee framework (excluding KeyCorp) and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system (including KeyCorp).  The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but related proposals: (i) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions; and (ii) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors (published by the Federal Reserve on August 3, 2017) identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution\u2019s governance and controls. The proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization\u2019s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors. In addition, the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letters that could be eliminated or revised. The Federal Reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until February 15, 2018.  On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final proposal related to the LFI Rating System - the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. This guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System, together with the above-mentioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s board of directors. In general, the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management, business line management, and the independent risk management and control function. The guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature, by appointing a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Audit Officer. Finally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management, internal controls, and internal audit, and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks. Comments on this proposal were due by March 15, 2018.  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (\u201cLMI\u201d) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions\u2019 safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.  On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency\u2019s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank\u2019s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds, benchmarks, and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023.  On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit  23  ---  access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due by February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations.  On November 24, 2020, the OCC requested public comment on an NPR setting forth the OCC\u2019s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank\u2019s performance under the general performance standards contained in the OCC\u2019s 2020 final CRA rule. The proposal also explains how the OCC would assess a significant decline in a bank\u2019s CRA activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums. Further, the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final CRA rule. Comments on the NPR are due by February 2, 2021. On December 15, 2020, the OCC published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the OCC would require banks subject to the CRA general performance standards to complete. The OCC said that it intends to use the bank-specific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the CRA rule. Comments on this notice are due by February 16, 2021.  Control standards  On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company\u2019s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (i) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies; and (ii) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. The final rule became effective September 30, 2020.  Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19  Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees.  During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers\u2019 needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Recent regulatory capital-related developments\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.  The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender.  24  ---  The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower\u2019s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time.  On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action.  The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks\u2019 deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules.  On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators,",

        "text": "Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation\u2019s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $170.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2020. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.  As of December\u00a031, 2020, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank\u2019s 1,073 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,386 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d section in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, securities lending, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services \u2014 both within and outside of our primary banking markets \u2014 through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp\u2019s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  We derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.  Demographics  In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our management structure and changed our basis of presentation into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (\u201cBusiness Segment Reporting\u201d) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.  The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital lending business by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs.  The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients  6  ---  in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance.

Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key\u2019s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  Human Capital  Engaging a diverse and talented team is a top strategic priority for Key.

Supervision and Regulation  The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers, the DIF, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit.  Overview  Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a \u201cbroker\u201d or a \u201cdealer\u201d in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation.  Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (\u201cFHC\u201d) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.  Under federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i)\u00a0identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii)\u00a0promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii)\u00a0respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  10  ---  As a FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December\u00a031, 2020, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory capital requirements  Background  KeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.  The regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (\u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d). Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.  A capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis. Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2. A banking organization\u2019s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  The Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above. For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization\u2019s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.  Basel III  To address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers. The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period (\u201cRegulatory Capital Rules\u201d). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust  11  ---  preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp); establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as \u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations.  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December\u00a031, 2020, KeyCorp\u2019s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.  Minimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under  Regulatory Capital Rules  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Ratios (including stress capital buffer) | | | Regulatory Minimum Requirement | | | Stress Capital Buffer (b) | | | Regulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer | | | KeyCorp December 31, 2020 (c) | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 | | | 4.50 | | % | 2.50 | | % | 7.00 | | % | 9.73 | | % | | Tier 1 Capital | | | 6.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 8.50 | |  | 11.11 | |  | | Total Capital | | | 8.00 | |  | 2.50 | |  | 10.50 | |  | 13.40 | |  | | Leverage (a) | | | 4.00 | |  | N/A | | | 4.00 | |  | 8.94 | |  |  (a)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.  (b)Stress Capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.  (c)Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.  Revised prompt corrective action framework  The federal prompt corrective action framework established under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January\u00a01, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.  \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d and \u201cAdequately Capitalized\u201d Capital Category Ratios under  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Prompt Corrective Action | | |  | | | Capital Category | | | | | | | | | | Ratio | | |  | | | Well\u00a0Capitalized\u00a0(a) | | |  | | | Adequately\u00a0Capitalized | | | | Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 6.5 | | % |  | | | 4.5 | | % | | Tier 1 Risk-Based | | |  | | | 8.0 | |  |  | | | 6.0 | |  | | Total Risk-Based | | |  | | | 10.0 | |  |  | | | 8.0 | |  | | Tier 1 Leverage (b) | | |  | | | 5.0 | |  |  | | | 4.0 | |  |  (a)A \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  (b)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January\u00a01, 2018.  We believe that, as of December\u00a031, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.  Recent regulatory capital-related developments  In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d) and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by: (1) enhancing the robustness and risk-sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment, and operational risk; (2) constraining the use of internal models  12  ---  by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (used by advanced approaches banking organizations) and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and operational risk; (3) introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically-important banks; and (4) replacing the existing Basel II output floor with a more robust, risk-sensitive floor based on the Basel III standardized approach.  The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee\u2019s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.  Subsequently, in December 2018, the Basel Committee released an update to its Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee\u2019s final revisions to Basel III. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017.  On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations, including Key. The final rule simplifies, for these banking organizations, the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25% deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250% risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. The final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the Regulatory Capital Rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule provided an effective date of October 1, 2019, for the technical amendments and an effective date of April 1, 2020, for the simplification changes. On November 13, 2019, the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either January 1, 2020, or April 1, 2020. We chose to implement the simplification changes on April 1, 2020.  In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the Regulatory Capital Rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate (\u201cHVCRE\u201d) exposure. HVCRE exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, conforms the HVCRE definition to statutory changes enacted in May 2018. The final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised HVCRE definition of credit facilities that finance one-to-four family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land.  A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years CECL\u2019s adverse effects on regulatory capital (\u201cCECL Interim Final Rule\u201d). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of  13  ---  regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL.  On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL\u2019s effects on regulatory capital.  Liquidity requirements  U.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee in 2010, and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 (as revised, the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d). The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.  To address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cBasel III LCR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (\u201cBasel III NSFR\u201d), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cLiquidity Coverage Rules\u201d). Consistent with the Basel III LCR, the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Rules established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (\u201cModified LCR\u201d) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.  In December 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the LCR and Modified LCR. Under the final rule, each calendar quarter KeyCorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its Modified LCR calculation, together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its Modified LCR. KeyCorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2018.  Large BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements (collectively, \u201cEPSs\u201d), including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  14  ---  EGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the EPS is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC\u2019s or BHCs\u2019 capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.  In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The final rules established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (\u201cCategory IV Firms\u201d). The Tailoring Rules became effective on December 31, 2019.  In one of the Tailoring Rules, the federal banking agencies amended various rules, including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements, thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this final rule, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a reduced LCR. KeyCorp believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced LCR. Thus, as of December 31, 2019, KeyCorp is no longer subject to an LCR requirement or an LCR public disclosure requirement.  In the other Tailoring Rule, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards (including liquidity standards) to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Under this rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required, calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly, and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm\u2019s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.  On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions established by the Tailoring Rules. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.  Capital planning and stress testing  The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC\u2019s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.  The Federal Reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and  15  ---  severely adverse scenarios (and through 2018, an adverse scenario), that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank has only had to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. KeyCorp has been required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests have been disclosed under the \u201cRegulatory Disclosures & Filings\u201d section of the \u201cFinancials\u201d tab of Key\u2019s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir.  One of the Tailoring Rules issued by the Federal Reserve in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA changes the stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs that are Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp). Under this rule, Category IV Firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case. In 2020, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.  A separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in October 2019 to implement a provision in EGRRCPA that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federally-regulated banks to conduct company-run stress tests on an annual basis from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. Under this final rule, federally-regulated banks with total assets of less than $250 billion (like KeyBank) will no longer be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the \u201cadverse\u201d scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC\u2019s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.  On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies\u2019 Regulatory Capital Rules.  In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions.  Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the  16  ---  appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms were prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances.  On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp\u2019s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp\u2019s stress capital requirement of 2.5%.  On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it planned to release firm-specific results from the firms\u2019 performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020.  Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that, in the aggregate, capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios. However, the Federal Reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty, it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. The Federal Reserve said that these firms (including KeyCorp) (1) are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (2) are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that, in the aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021.  On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations.  Dividend restrictions  Federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank\u2019s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the  17  ---  payment would cause it to be less than \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. Large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the Federal Reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on these restrictions, please see the section above entitled \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing\u201d and for more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (\u201cRestrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities\u201d) in this report.  FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability  Deposit insurance and assessments  The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor\u2019s deposits is $250,000 per depository.  The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution\u2019s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank\u2019s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank\u2019s performance on the FDIC\u2019s \u201clarge and highly complex institution\u201d risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank\u2019s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank\u2019s failure.  In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank), to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution\u2019s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the bank\u2019s CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. On July 16, 2019, the FDIC approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule. Among other things, the amendments to this rule (i) provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than April 1, 2021, upon notification to the FDIC; (ii) clarify the certification requirement; (iii) revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a pass-through basis (where the bank\u2019s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds); and (iv) streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the FDIC.  Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution\u2019s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution\u2019s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.  18  ---  Receivership of certain SIFIs  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d (\u201cOLA\u201d) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI\u2019s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.  If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC\u2019s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors\u2019 claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC\u2019s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors\u2019 claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC\u2019s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.  In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI\u2019s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014.  Depositor preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution\u2019s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  Resolution plans  BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.  In October 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large BHCs. Under this final rule, BHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this final rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements.  19  ---  On April 16, 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions, including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas: (i) creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size, complexity, and other factors; (ii) revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions, including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions; (iii) improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the FDIC and institutions on resolution-related matters; and (iv) revision of the $50 billion asset threshold in the current rule. The FDIC indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements. Under each of these approaches, institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan. The FDIC would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions. Comments on this ANPR were due by June 21, 2019. Any changes to this rule will impact KeyBank. The FDIC extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed.  On January 19, 2021, the FDIC issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans. The FDIC said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues. The FDIC further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm.  Other Regulatory Developments  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA\u2019s requirements.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  Volcker Rule  The Volcker Rule implements Section\u00a0619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits \u201cbanking entities,\u201d such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as \u201ccovered funds\u201d) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.  The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis.  20  ---  Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April\u00a01, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July\u00a021, 2017, with respect to covered funds. In addition, on December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments (i.e., contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before May 1, 2010, to make an investment) in \u201cilliquid\u201d covered funds.  Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in Note 6 (\u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d) in Item\u00a08 of this report. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.  On October 8, 2019, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the Volcker Rule; (ii) modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions; (iii) adds additional proprietary trading exclusions; and (iv) tailors the rule\u2019s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm\u2019s trading assets and liabilities. Under the final rule, a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has \u201csignificant\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least $20 billion. A banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $20 billion is regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity\u2019s activities, size, scope, and complexity. A presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with \u201climited\u201d trading assets and liabilities, that is, total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion. The final rule rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the compliance date was January 1, 2021. Key believes that it will be regarded as having \u201cmoderate\u201d trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule. We do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on Key.  On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose EPSs upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.  The resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2019. In 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test, early remediation, and SCCL requirements. However, when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012, it included only the stress test requirements and not the SCCL or early remediation requirements.  21  ---  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the EPSs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including: (i)\u00a0the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve\u2019s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (ii)\u00a0liquidity requirements; (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (iv)\u00a0a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January\u00a01, 2015.  EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, raised, from $50 billion to $250 billion, the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply EPSs to BHCs. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority, following notice and comment procedures, to continue to apply EPSs to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp). Also, this statute requires the Federal Reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion (like KeyCorp), and the requirement for a publicly traded BHC to have a risk committee continues to apply if a BHC has assets of at least $50 billion.  On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements for BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011.  In one of the Tailoring Rules issued in October 2019 to implement EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve amended certain of its rules governing EPSs to apply tailored regulatory standards to large BHCs in each of the four risk-based categories of institutions described in the Tailoring Rules. Based on Key\u2019s analysis of the Tailoring Rules, KeyCorp believes that it is a Category IV Firm, the least restrictive of these categories. The Tailoring Rules are discussed further under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d  Bank transactions with affiliates  Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank\u2019s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm\u2019s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank\u2019s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp\u2019s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i)\u00a0the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser; (ii)\u00a0credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions; and (iii)\u00a0transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July\u00a021, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.  Supervision and governance  On November 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, including BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (like KeyCorp) (\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), in order to align the Federal Reserve\u2019s rating system with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms. The LFI Rating System will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions  22  ---  and will assess an institution\u2019s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System will be rated using the following scale: Broadly Meets Expectations, Conditionally Meets Expectations, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Conditionally Meets Expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation. The Federal Reserve assigned initial ratings under the LFI Rating System in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee framework (excluding KeyCorp) and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system (including KeyCorp).  The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but related proposals: (i) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions; and (ii) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors (published by the Federal Reserve on August 3, 2017) identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution\u2019s governance and controls. The proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization\u2019s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors. In addition, the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letters that could be eliminated or revised. The Federal Reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until February 15, 2018.  On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final proposal related to the LFI Rating System - the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. This guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System, together with the above-mentioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s board of directors. In general, the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management, business line management, and the independent risk management and control function. The guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature, by appointing a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Audit Officer. Finally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management, internal controls, and internal audit, and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks. Comments on this proposal were due by March 15, 2018.  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (\u201cLMI\u201d) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions\u2019 safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.  On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency\u2019s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank\u2019s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds, benchmarks, and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023.  On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit  23  ---  access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due by February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations.  On November 24, 2020, the OCC requested public comment on an NPR setting forth the OCC\u2019s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank\u2019s performance under the general performance standards contained in the OCC\u2019s 2020 final CRA rule. The proposal also explains how the OCC would assess a significant decline in a bank\u2019s CRA activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums. Further, the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final CRA rule. Comments on the NPR are due by February 2, 2021. On December 15, 2020, the OCC published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the OCC would require banks subject to the CRA general performance standards to complete. The OCC said that it intends to use the bank-specific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks, thresholds, and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the CRA rule. Comments on this notice are due by February 16, 2021.  Control standards  On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company\u2019s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (i) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies; and (ii) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. The final rule became effective September 30, 2020.  Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19  Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees.  During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers\u2019 needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Recent regulatory capital-related developments\u201d and \u201cRegulatory capital requirements \u2014 Capital planning and stress testing.\u201d In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.  The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender.  24  ---  The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower\u2019s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time.  On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action.  The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks\u2019 deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules.  On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators,",
