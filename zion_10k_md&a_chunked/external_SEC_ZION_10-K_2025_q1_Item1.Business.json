We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2024, served by 404 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,406 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2024.\n\nWe conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management teams. These affiliate banks constitute our primary business segments as referenced throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks.\n\nFor more information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) on page 43 and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n5\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nWe strive to develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and high-quality service.

Our primary competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and various other types of companies. Some of our competitors may face fewer regulatory constraints, and have greater capabilities to develop, implement, and offer innovative financial services and technologies. They may also benefit from lower cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.\n\nOur key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, the convenience of branch and office locations, the wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all these areas to remain successful.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nThe banking and financial services business in which we operate is highly regulated. These regulations are designed to promote the safety, soundness, and stability of banking and financial institutions, and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, communities, the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking and financial system as a whole. Generally, these regulations are not intended to protect shareholders, investors, or non-depositor creditors. Banking laws and regulations have granted federal banking regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies, are unpredictable and may have a material effect on our business and results.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are governed by the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes applicable to national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). Additionally, we and some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.\n\nThe National Bank Act\n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, with related regulations administered by the OCC. In terms of securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which grants the OCC the authority to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks. Despite this, we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. The statutory and regulatory frameworks applicable to us as a national bank are not as well developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks that apply to many other publicly held companies.\n\nCapital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2024, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include specific risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, which affect banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. This buffer is composed entirely\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nof common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of these constraints depends on the shortfall amount and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d defined as the greater of (1) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income, or (2) average net income over the preceding four quarters.\n\nFor more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 77.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to address identified issues in insured depository institutions, particularly those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Under FDICIA, the FDIC has established regulations defining five categories for insured depository institutions based on their capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.\n\nAccording to the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution is generally classified as well capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. Conversely, an insured depository institution is generally classified as undercapitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%.\n\nAn institution classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking regulator, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution faces more restrictions and prohibitions, including limitations on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, acceptance of brokered deposits, and payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.\n\nThe following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2024, and the minimum requirements to be well capitalized:\n\nMINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | December 31, 2024 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d | | |\n|  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5% | | | 2.5% | | | 7.0% | | |  | | | 10.9% | | | 6.5% | | |\n| Tier 1 risk-based capital  (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0% | | | 2.5% | | | 8.5% | | |  | | | 11.0% | | | 8.0% | | |\n| Total risk-based capital  (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0% | | | 2.5% | | | 10.5% | | |  | | | 13.3% | | | 10.0% | | |\n| Tier 1 leverage ratio  (i.e., Tier 1 risk-based capital) to average consolidated assets | | | 4.0% | | | N/A | | | 4.0% | | |  | | | 8.3% | | | 5.0% | | |\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nRegulatory Developments\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning\n\nEffective October 1, 2024, the FDIC revised its rule regarding the resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets. Beginning in 2025, banks with $100 billion or more in total assets that are not affiliates of U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (\u201ccovered banks\u201d) are required to submit full resolution plans with an identified resolution strategy every three years. Banks with $50 billion to $100 billion in total assets are required to submit more limited information triennially. The guidance also requires these banks to file interim supplemental information regarding their resolution planning in off-cycle years. We expect to file our first informational submission in late 2025.\n\nIn October 2024, the OCC issued a final rule amending its recovery planning guidelines for insured national banks. The guidelines require covered banks to develop and maintain a recovery plan tailored to their size, risk profile, activities, and complexity, including their organizational and legal entity structure. The recovery plan, subject to annual testing to validate its effectiveness, should consider both financial and non-financial risks and include elements such as: (1) a range of credible options to restore financial strength and viability, allowing the bank to continue operating as a going concern, and (2) an analysis of how each recovery option might affect capital, liquidity, and funding. We would be required to comply with these guidelines within 12 months after becoming a covered bank.\n\nBasel III Endgame\n\nIn July 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. Commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d this proposal would significantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations, defined as those with $100 billion or more in total assets. At December\u00a031, 2024, we had $88.8 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization.\n\nUnder the proposal, if our total assets were to increase to $100 billion or more, we would be required to: (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d), such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities, in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach. The Federal Reserve has indicated its intention to collaborate with the other federal banking regulators on a revised proposal in 2025.\n\nLong-term Debt\n\nIn August 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposal to expand the long-term debt requirement to all banks with $100 billion or more in total assets. The proposed rule requires these banks to maintain a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. Under the proposal, if our total assets were to increase to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue the necessary debt and meet other requirements. If adopted as proposed, and assuming our assets and liabilities remain largely consistent with those at December\u00a031, 2024, the estimated amount of incremental debt required to meet the new requirements would be approximately $3.1 billion, to be issued over the three-year phase-in period. We anticipate that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding, with the timing of any issuance influenced by economic factors and associated borrowing costs.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December 31, 2022, the FDIC initially expected to collect the special\n\n9\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nassessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, the FDIC announced that the special assessment would be collected at a lower rate for an additional two quarterly assessment periods, totaling ten periods. During 2023 and 2024, we recorded approximately $101 million in deposit insurance and regulatory expense related to the FDIC special assessment.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nWe use stress testing as an important tool to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital to maintain, based on hypothetically stressed economic conditions, comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our most recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected: (1) high inflation, (2) declining commercial property values, (3) increased losses on commercial loans due to declining asset values and slowing economic activity, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.\n\nLiquidity\n\nWe utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines. These guidelines encompass holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2024, our sources of liquidity exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to changes in the interest rate environment.\n\nFor more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 73.\n\nFinancial Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\nThe federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to unaffiliated third parties. These regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside suppliers.\n\nAdditionally, consumers may prevent the disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as information shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for marketing purposes. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\n\nFederal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, SEC rules require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, in recent years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations that grant consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establish or modify data breach notification requirements, and require certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal legislators and bank regulators.\n\n10\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nOpen Banking\n\nIn October 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule imposes new data access requirements on various parties in the financial ecosystem, including financial institutions, data aggregators, and businesses authorized by consumers to access information on their behalf. Among other requirements, the rule requires certain entities, including the Bank, to make available to consumers, upon request, information in their control or possession regarding the consumer financial products or services obtained from the Bank.\n\nThe rule also requires data providers, such as the Bank, to establish a developer interface that meets specific security specifications. This interface will allow data providers to receive requests for and provide specific types of data covered by the rule in an electronic, usable form to authorized third parties, including data aggregators. The current compliance deadline for a bank our size is April 1, 2027. We are preparing to comply with the rule, although it is currently the subject of several lawsuits that may affect its implementation.\n\nOther Regulations and Proposals\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\u2022Limitations on Dividends Payable to Shareholders \u2014 Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\u2022Safety and Soundness Standards \u2014 Prescribed in FDICIA, these standards relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by federal banking regulators.\n\n\u2022Approval of Acquisitions and Restrictions on Other Activities \u2014 The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.\n\n\u2022Limits on Interchange Fees \u2014 Imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, these rules require interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions to be reasonable and proportional to transaction processing costs. In October 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed revising Regulation II to lower the maximum permitted debit interchange fee by almost 30% and instituting a biennial review of the cap without public comment. This proposal is the subject of litigation, which may delay or affect its outcome. If finalized as proposed, the revised regulation could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.\n\n\u2022Limitations on Loans \u2014 Restrictions on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.\n\n\u2022Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates.\n\n\u2022Limitations on Investments and Securities \u2014 Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and the ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).\n\n\u2022Branches \u2014 Requirements for opening and closing of branches.\n\n\u2022Consumer Protection Laws \u2014 A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, provide equal access to credit and protect consumers in credit transactions. As a bank with $10 billion or more in total assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often reduce bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. For example, the CFPB recently extended certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and has proposed placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks related to providing financial services to customers.\n\n11\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ife0326c4111140cd9b9a309d8b182033_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) \u2014 The CRA requires that banks address the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. Failure to adequately serve our communities may result in penalties, such as denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, or merge with or acquire other financial institutions. Federal banking regulators recently finalized rules that significantly overhaul the evaluation framework used to assess a bank\u2019s performance and compliance with CRA requirements. These changes may make it more challenging for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. Currently, these new rules are subject to challenge in federal court by several financial services industry trade associations. The court has blocked enforcement against the plaintiffs while the case is pending.\n\n\u2022Compensation Requirements \u2014 Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and other rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n\u2022Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) Regulations \u2014 The Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d), Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity. Federal law grants broad enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and other government agencies with respect to AML, BSA, and Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) laws and regulations, including the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties and restitution and issue cease and desist or similar orders.\n\n\u2022Tax laws \u2014 Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.\n\nWe are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations. These regulations address various matters, including corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.\n\nSustainability standards and related concerns, including those associated with global climate change, continue to evolve and have become increasingly prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. We strive to enhance our business by incorporating sustainable practices that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities. Examples include: our LEED Platinum-certified technology campus and other LEED-certified facilities, water conservation systems, use of remote deposit capture and electronic forms and signatures, financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, and subsidizing employee use of public transportation.\n\nIn addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal banking regulators, such as their principles designed to help large financial institutions manage their exposure to climate-related risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California has enacted comprehensive climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and publish biennial reports beginning in January 2026. These reports will disclose climate-related financial risks and measures adopted to reduce and adapt to those risks.\n\nAmong other requirements, the California climate-related disclosure laws require the public disclosure of GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from our energy use (Scope 2) beginning in 2026, and our indirect upstream and downstream supply-chain GHG emissions (Scope 3) starting in 2027.

We continue to focus on enhancing our brand in the markets we serve to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, which is essential for our long-term success and value creation for our investors.\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2024, we had 9,406 full-time equivalent employees.

The in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and cultivates a strong corporate culture while offering flexibility to balance personal needs.\n\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success\n\nWe are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals to serve the diverse markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.\n\nConsistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and in providing them with the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options, enabling employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2024, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, and assist in career advancement. Our offerings include new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs.\n\nOur talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees. We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continuously analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.\n\nRecognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees\n\nOur comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enrich the employee experience through meaningful recognition and growth opportunities. We offer upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives, enabling us to achieve superior results while mitigating risk.\n\nWe routinely assess pay equity across our organization to ensure fair compensation for all employees. Every two years, we engage an independent third party to review our pay equity. The most recent review, which accounted for variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, found no meaningful differences in pay levels across our workforce. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.\n\nOur employees regularly provide feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, including quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, town hall meetings, and targeted focus groups. These forums facilitate stronger relationships with managers, clarify organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics."
