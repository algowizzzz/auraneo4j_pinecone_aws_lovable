Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.

The amount of income from such sources during those years is recorded in various business segments and is set forth in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income and Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n\nSupervision and Regulation of the Company\n\nM&T and its subsidiaries are subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC\u2019s DIF and\n\n3\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nthe banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors.\n\nProposals to change the applicable regulatory framework may be introduced in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to M&T or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.\n\nDescribed hereafter are material elements of the significant federal and state laws and regulations applicable to M&T and its subsidiaries.\n\nOverview\n\nM&T is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) as a financial holding company and BHC under the BHCA. As such, M&T and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, examination, reporting, capital and other requirements of the BHCA and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. In addition, M&T\u2019s banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, as applicable, the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYSDFS\u201d), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and their consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). Further, financial services entities such as M&T\u2019s investment advisor and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d), among others. Other non-bank affiliates and activities, particularly insurance brokerage and agency activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations as well as licensing and regulation by state insurance and bank regulatory agencies. Although the scope of regulation and the form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity as well as regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, and reporting.\n\nM&T Bank is a New York chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve. As a result, it is subject to extensive regulation, examination and oversight by the NYSDFS and the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\") of New York. New York laws and regulations govern many aspects of M&T Bank\u2019s operations, including branching, dividends, subsidiary activities, fiduciary activities, lending, and deposit taking. M&T Bank is also subject to Federal Reserve regulations and guidance, including with respect to capital levels. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC, subject to certain limitations, which also exercises regulatory oversight over certain aspects of M&T Bank\u2019s operations.\n\nWilmington Trust, N.A. is a national bank with operations that include fiduciary and related activities with limited lending and deposit business. It is subject to extensive regulation, examination and oversight by the OCC which governs many aspects of its operations, including fiduciary activities, capital levels, office locations, dividends and subsidiary activities. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC,\n\n4\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nsubject to certain limitations, which also exercises regulatory oversight over certain aspects of the operations of Wilmington Trust, N.A.\n\nCertain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by other federal and state regulators as well. For example, M&T Securities is regulated by the SEC, FINRA, SIPC, and state securities regulators, and WT Investment Advisors and PUA are also subject to SEC regulation.\n\nPermissible Activities under the BHC Act\n\nIn general, the BHCA limits the business of a BHC to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies are obligated by a Federal Reserve policy to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions, including committing resources to support such subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when M&T may not be inclined or able to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\n\nBank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve, by regulation or order, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and merchant banking.\n\nM&T elected to become a financial holding company in March 2011. To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed.\u201d The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of M&T and may also adversely affect M&T\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, or obtain necessary approvals in connection with those transactions, as well as loss of financial holding company status. Additionally, if each of the Company\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries has not received at least a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating on its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the \u201cCRA\u201d), the Company would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although it would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities. For a further discussion of the CRA, see the section captioned \u201cCommunity Reinvestment Act\u201d included herein.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\n\nUnder Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including M&T, are subject to enhanced prudential standards. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, risk management and risk committee requirements, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined would pose a grave threat to systemic financial stability were they to fail such limits. \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d adopted by the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in 2019 assign each U.S. BHC with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and five other\n\n5\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nrisk-based indicators: (i) cross-jurisdictional activity, (ii) weighted short-term wholesale funding, (iii) nonbank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) status as a U.S. global systemically important BHC (\u201cG-SIB\u201d). Under the Tailoring Rules, M&T and its depository institution subsidiaries are subject to Category IV standards, which apply to banking organizations with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for Categories I through III. The threshold for Category III is $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, or $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and at least $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets or off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, among other things, (i) are not subject to any Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) or Net Stable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) (or, in certain cases, are subject to reduced requirements), (ii) remain eligible to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital, (iii) are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements, (iv) are subject to supervisory stress testing on at least a biennial basis rather than an annual basis, (v) are subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and (vi) are subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements. The Federal Reserve may impose more stringent requirements (e.g. frequency of supervisory stress tests or capital plan submissions) based on a company\u2019s financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of operations or activities, or risks to the U.S. economy. Category IV firms continue not to be subject to (i) advanced approaches capital requirements, (ii) the supplementary leverage ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d) and (iii) the countercyclical capital buffer (\u201cCCyB\u201d). Other elements of the Tailoring Rules are discussed in further detail throughout this section. Compared with Category IV firms, Category III firms are subject to the LCR and NSFR, company-run stress testing requirements, annual (instead of biennial) supervisory stress tests, the SLR and the CCyB.\n\nCapital Requirements\n\nM&T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies (the \u201cCapital Rules\u201d), which are based on the Basel Committee\u2019s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, referred to as \u201cBasel III\u201d. The Capital Rules include both risk-based requirements, which compare three measures of capital to risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWAs\u201d), as well as leverage requirements, which, in the case of Category IV bank holding companies such as M&T, consist of the Tier 1 leverage ratio described below. Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\n4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (\u201cCET1\u201d) to RWAs;\n\n\u2022\n\n6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to RWAs;\n\n\u2022\n\n8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to RWAs; and\n\n\u2022\n\n4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (the \u201cleverage ratio\u201d).\n\nIn calculating risk-based capital ratios, M&T must assign risk weights to the Company\u2019s assets and off-balance sheet items. M&T has an ongoing process to review data elements associated with these exposures that from time to time may affect how specific exposures are classified and could lead to increases or decreases of the regulatory risk weights assigned to such exposures.\n\nThe Capital Rules also require firms to maintain a \u201cbuffer,\u201d consisting solely of CET1 capital, in addition to the minimum risk-based requirements. Failure to satisfy the buffer requirement in full results in graduated constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the firm\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions\n\n6\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nand associated tax effects not reflected in net income and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters.\n\nAs a Category IV BHC, M&T\u2019s buffer requirement, referred to as the \u201cStress Capital Buffer,\u201d is determined through the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests, discussed below. For M&T\u2019s bank subsidiaries, the buffer requirement consists of the static capital conservation buffer equal to 2.5% of RWAs.\n\nCET1 consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the Capital Rules, including common stock and related surplus, net of treasury stock, retained earnings, certain minority interests and, for certain firms, AOCI. As permitted under the Capital Rules, M&T made a one-time permanent election to neutralize certain AOCI components, with the result that those components are not recognized in M&T\u2019s CET1.\n\nThe Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. As a \u201cnon-advanced approaches\u201d firm under the Capital Rules, M&T is subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital. M&T\u2019s and its subsidiary banks\u2019 regulatory capital ratios are presented in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain \u201cunconditionally cancellable commitments,\u201d such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of these standards will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the federal banking regulators.\n\nStress Testing and Stress Capital Buffer\n\nAs part of the enhanced prudential requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions, the Federal Reserve conducts periodic analyses of bank holding companies with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets using baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios generated by the Federal Reserve. For Category IV firms, such as M&T, these supervisory stress tests occur on a biennial basis, in even-numbered years. The Federal Reserve may also use additional components in the severely adverse scenario or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific business groups. A summary of results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario is publicly disclosed. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, including M&T, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements.\n\nBank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including Category IV bank holding companies such as M&T, must annually submit capital plans as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s process. The comprehensive capital plans include a view of capital adequacy under various scenarios \u2014 including a BHC-defined baseline scenario, a baseline scenario provided by the Federal Reserve, at least one BHC-defined stress scenario, and any severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The process is intended to help ensure that these bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company\u2019s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. Each of the bank holding companies participating in the process is also required to collect and report certain related data\n\n7\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nto the Federal Reserve on a regular basis. The Stress Capital Buffer is based on a BHC\u2019s stressed losses in the supervisory stress test, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5% of RWAs. In June 2022, the Federal Reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests. Based on those results, on October 1, 2022, M&T's stress capital buffer of 4.7% became effective. Accordingly, it currently is subject to a CET1 capital requirement of 9.2% (a sum of the Stress Capital Buffer and the minimum CET1 capital ratio).\n\nIn January 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to align its process with the categories set forth in the Tailoring Rules. Under the final rule, for Category IV firms, the portion of the Stress Capital Buffer based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests will be calculated biennially, in even-numbered years. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm will receive an updated Stress Capital Buffer that reflects the firm\u2019s updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV firm is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the firm would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated Stress Capital Buffer. The Federal Reserve may impose more stringent requirements (e.g., frequency of supervisory stress tests or capital plan submissions) based on various factors. In connection with the acquisition of People's United, M&T will be required to participate in the 2023 supervisory stress test and receive an updated Stress Capital Buffer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firm\u2019s capital planning process into regular, ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted, horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning. M&T\u2019s annual capital plan is currently due in April each year. The Federal Reserve publishes the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30 of each year.\n\nA BHC\u2019s planned capital distributions in its annual capital plan submissions must be consistent with any effective distribution limitations that would apply under the firm\u2019s own baseline projections, including its Stress Capital Buffer.\n\nDistributions\n\nM&T is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Historically, the majority of M&T\u2019s revenue has been from dividends paid to M&T by its subsidiary banks. M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. are subject to laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay. Future dividend payments to M&T by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors, including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies.\n\nAn insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed herein. Dividend payments by M&T to its shareholders and common stock repurchases by M&T are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. M&T\u2019s ability to make capital distributions would likely be impacted in the event that M&T fails to maintain its Stress Capital Buffer above its minimum CET1 risk-based, Tier-1 risk-based and total risk-based capital requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule also provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase, or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmong other circumstances, a firm may be required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with certain acquisitions or dispositions.\n\nLiquidity\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, as a Category IV firm, the Company is not subject to the Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators rules that implement a U.S. version of the Basel Committee\u2019s LCR requirement, which is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of so-called \u201chigh quality liquid assets\u201d (\u201cHQLA\u201d) to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30-day stress scenario or the NSFR, which is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. The Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential standards, however, require the Company, as a BHC with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Under the Tailoring Rules, the liquidity risk management and reporting requirements are less stringent for Category IV bank holding companies as compared with bank holding companies in a different Category.\n\nCross Guaranty Provision\n\nThe cross guaranty provisions in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\u201cFDIA\u201d) require each insured depository institution owned by the same BHC to be financially responsible for the failure or resolution costs of any affiliated insured institution. Generally, the amount of the cross guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the DIF for the resolution of the affiliated institution(s) in default. The FDIC\u2019s claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its BHC and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF.\n\nVolcker Rule\n\nThe Volcker Rule limits proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds (defined as \u201ccovered funds\u201d in the Volcker Rule). The Company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker Rule and implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur. In addition, the Company does not engage in any significant covered fund activities that are impacted by the Volcker Rule.\n\nSafety and Soundness Standards\n\nGuidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the FDIA establish general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. Additionally, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject. If an institution fails to comply with such an\n\n9\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\norder, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\n\nLimits on Undercapitalized Depository Institutions\n\nThe FDIA establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions, referred to as the prompt corrective action. The federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (\u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d) and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The federal banking regulators have specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category. The FDIA\u2019s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d A financial holding company that is not well-capitalized and well-managed (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed) under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status. Under existing rules, a depository institution is deemed to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it has (i) a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, (iii) a Total capital ratio of at least 10%, and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nAn institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than prevailing market rates, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates\n\nThere are various legal restrictions on the extent to which M&T and its non-bank subsidiaries or affiliates (including M&T Realty Capital, M&T Securities, WT Investment Advisors and PUA) may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. In general, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W require that any \u201ccovered transaction\u201d by M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. (or any of their respective subsidiaries) with an affiliate must in certain cases be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited as follows: (i) in the case of any single such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution, and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution. \u201cCovered\n\n10\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\ntransactions\u201d are defined by statute to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on terms and under circumstances including credit standards, (i) that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies, or in the absence of comparable transactions, (ii) that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies.\n\nFDIC Insurance Assessments\n\nM&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for financial institutions. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity. For larger institutions, such as M&T Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank\u2019s capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nUnder the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\n\nOn October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight years. The increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nFederal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies. For example, the BHCA requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings institution, if after such acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of the institution; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings institution; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate with any other BHC. In addition, financial holding companies are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion.\n\nThe BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects\n\n11\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nof the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues and includes the parties\u2019 performance under the CRA and compliance with laws, especially consumer protection laws. When evaluating a transaction, the Federal Reserve must also take into account the institutions\u2019 effectiveness in combating money laundering and consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.\n\nExecutive and Incentive Compensation\n\nGuidelines adopted by several federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as \u201cexcessive\u201d when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. The Federal Reserve issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the \u201cIncentive Compensation Guidance\u201d) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act noted below. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance states that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as M&T and M&T Bank. The agencies proposed rules to implement this requirement but these proposed rules have not been finalized.\n\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the New York Stock Exchange, to require policies mandating the recovery or \u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentive-based compensation been determined using the restated financials. The final rule requires the exchanges to propose conforming listing standards by February 26, 2023 and requires the standards to become effective no later than November 28, 2023. Each listed issuer, which includes M&T as a listed issuer on the New York Stock Exchange, would\n\n12\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nthen be required to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after its exchange\u2019s listing standard has become effective. M&T will work to implement these new requirements as the rule becomes effective.\n\nIn addition, the NYSDFS issued guidance emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions, including M&T Bank, must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\n\nResolution Planning\n\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by EGRRCPA, certain bank holding companies are required to report periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In late 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued modified rules that, among other things, adjusted the review cycles and applicability of the agencies\u2019 resolution planning requirements. Under these rules, Category IV firms such as M&T are not required to submit resolution plans.\n\nThe FDIC has separately required insured depository institutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d) with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as M&T Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution\u2019s failure. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted its existing moratorium on resolution plans, resuming the requirement for resolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets. The FDIC also announced its intention to engage in targeted engagement and capabilities testing related to resolution planning with select firms, for which M&T Bank most recently participated during 2021. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans for IDI\u2019s, which, among other things, provides general information regarding the content that filers are expected to prepare and extends the submission frequency for specified IDI\u2019s to a three-year resolution plan filing cycle. Pursuant to this filing cycle, M&T Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC in November 2022.\n\nInsolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as M&T Bank or Wilmington Trust, N.A., upon its insolvency or in certain other events without limitation, the FDIC has the power:\n\n\u2022\n\nto transfer any of the depository institution\u2019s assets and liabilities to a new depository institution, including a newly formed \u201cbridge\u201d bank without the approval of the insolvent depository institution\u2019s creditors or equity holders;\n\n\u2022\n\nto enforce the terms of the depository institution\u2019s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n\n\u2022\n\nto repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.\n\nIn addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution, in the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of M&T Bank or Wilmington Trust, N.A., the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of the bank.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d) for systemically important financial companies, including bank holding companies and their affiliates. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically\n\n13\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nimportant institution, and its failed subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the entity if, among other conditions, it is determined at the time of the institution\u2019s failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system.\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA. However, the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors\u2019 claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as compared with the treatment of those claims under the new authority. Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors\u2019 claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a \u201cbridge\u201d entity.\n\nAn orderly liquidation fund will fund such liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury Department and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, M&T could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund.\n\nThe FDIC has developed a strategy under the orderly liquidation authority referred to as the \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a \u201cbridge\u201d holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed financial holding company would bear the losses resulting from the failure.\n\nDepositor Preference\n\nUnder federal law, depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of such an institution by any receiver. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent BHC, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.\n\nFinancial Privacy and Cyber Security\n\nThe federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public and personally identifiable information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset\n\n14\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nand income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\n\nIn November 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule requiring banking organizations to notify their primary regulator as soon as possible and within 36 hours of determining that a \u201cnotification incident\u201d has occurred. A notification incident is a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The final rule also requires specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents. The rule was effective April 1, 2022, with compliance required by May 1, 2022.\n\nFinancial institutions regulated by the NYSDFS, including M&T Bank, are also subject to NYSDFS regulations on cybersecurity matters, including, among other things, requirements to (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems, (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.\n\nOn November 9, 2022, the NYSDFS released proposed amendments to its cybersecurity regulations that represent a significant update to the regulation of cybersecurity practices. The amendments generally fall within the following five categories: (i) increased mandatory controls associated with common attack vectors, (ii) enhanced requirements for privileged accounts, (iii) enhanced notification obligations, (iv) expansion of cyber governance practices and (v) additional cybersecurity requirements for larger companies. Most amendments as proposed would become effective within 180 days of adoption.\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that would require registrants, such as M&T, to (i) report material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K, (ii) include updated disclosure in Forms 10-K and 10-Q of previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents and disclose previously undisclosed individually immaterial incidents when a determination is made that they have become material on an aggregated basis, (iii) disclose cybersecurity policies and procedures and governance practices, including at the board and management levels in Form 10-K and (iv) disclose the board of directors\u2019 cybersecurity expertise.\n\nMany states and regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations, including implementing or modifying their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. One example of recent state legislation is the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020 and applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. November 2020 amendments expanding the scope of and requirements under the CCPA generally became effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nConsumer Protection Laws and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision\n\nIn connection with their respective lending and leasing activities, M&T Bank, Wilmington Trust, N.A. and certain of their subsidiaries, are each subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. Such laws include: the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act,\n\n15\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nthe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Military Lending Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and various state law counterparts. Furthermore, the CFPB has issued integrated disclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that relate to the provision of disclosures to consumers. There are also consumer protection laws governing deposit taking activities (e.g. the Expedited Funds Availability Act and the Truth in Savings Act), as well as securities and insurance laws governing certain aspects of the Company\u2019s consolidated operations.\n\nThe CFPB has broad powers to supervise and enforce most federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices which violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including M&T Bank.\n\nIn addition, federal law permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nThe CRA is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. CRA examinations are conducted by the federal agencies that are responsible for supervising the relevant depository institutions: the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC. For purposes of the CRA, M&T is regulated by the Federal Reserve. A financial institution\u2019s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its community is evaluated in the context of information about the institution (capacity, constraints and business strategies), its community (demographic and economic data, lending, investment, and service opportunities), and its competitors and peers. Upon completion of a CRA examination, an overall CRA Rating is assigned using a four-tiered rating system. These ratings are: \u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d and \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d The CRA evaluation is used in evaluating applications for future approval of bank activities including mergers, acquisitions, charters, branch openings and deposit facilities. An unsatisfactory CRA evaluation could result in the delay or denial of acquisition or merger applications, among other activities. M&T Bank has a current rating of \u201cOutstanding.\u201d M&T Bank is also subject to New York State CRA examination and is assessed using a 1 to 4 scoring system. M&T Bank currently has a rating of 1, or \u201cOutstanding\u201d from the NYSDFS. Wilmington Trust, N.A. has been designated a special purpose trust company since March 3, 2016, and is therefore exempt from the requirements of the CRA. In May 2022, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC jointly issued a proposed rule to modernize Federal banking regulators\u2019 regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed rule would adjust CRA evaluations based on bank size and type, with many of the proposed changes applying only to banks with over $2 billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $10 billion in assets, such as M&T. The effects on the Company of any potential change to the CRA rules will depend on the final form of any Federal Reserve rulemaking.\n\nBank Secrecy Act Regulation and Anti-Money Laundering Obligations\n\nFederal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker/dealer subsidiaries, to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to verify the identity of their customers. These provisions also require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions. Failure of a\n\n16\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nfinancial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including the denial by federal regulators of proposed merger, acquisition, restructuring or other expansionary activity.\n\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), which drafts regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act legislation, has adopted rules that require financial institutions to, among other things, obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and M&T continues to monitor and augment, where necessary, its Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cBSA/AML\u201d) Compliance Program.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. In June 2021, FinCEN issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. M&T reviews and monitors its anti-money laundering compliance program to ensure it complies with the changes reflected in the AMLA and the regulations that implement it.\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\n\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that prohibit transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the \u201cOFAC\u201d rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on \u201cU.S. persons\u201d engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including denial by federal regulators of proposed merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary activity. The OFAC rules are included as part of M&T\u2019s BSA/AML Compliance Program, which M&T continues to monitor and augment, where necessary.\n\nRegulation of Insurers and Insurance Brokers\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of insurance agency/brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents\n\n17\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nand the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Certain of M&T\u2019s subsidiaries that are engaged in insurance-related activities are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, reporting and examinations.\n\nFederal Reserve Policies\n\nThe earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies or the effect which they may have on the Company\u2019s business and earnings.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nM&T\u2019s Corporate Governance Standards and the following corporate governance documents are also available on M&T\u2019s website at the Investor Relations link: Audit Committee Charter; Compensation and Human Capital Committee Charter; Executive Committee Charter; Nomination and Governance Committee Charter; Risk Committee Charter; Disclosure and Regulation FD Policy; Code of Ethics for CEO and Senior Financial Officers; and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In accordance with SEC rules, M&T will post on its website or file a Form 8-K to report any amendment to or waiver from any provision of the Code of Ethics for CEO and Senior Financial Officers or the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, or persons performing similar functions. Copies of such governance documents are also available, free of charge, to any person who requests them. Such requests may be directed to M&T Bank Corporation, Shareholder Relations Department, One M&T Plaza, 8th Floor, Buffalo, NY 14203-2399 (Telephone: (716) 842-5138).\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nM&T recognizes employees are the difference makers that drive its success. The Company\u2019s talent strategy focuses on recruiting, engaging, developing and retaining high-performing individuals whose strengths align with M&T\u2019s values, purpose and leadership competencies to create and maintain a highly competitive and diverse workforce.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 22,808 full-time and part-time employees. The Company\u2019s current employee base is concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, with approximately 51% of employees residing in New York, followed by approximately 10% in Connecticut and 9% in each of Delaware and Maryland. The remainder are primarily concentrated in other states where M&T Bank maintains a retail bank branch presence. Approximately 4% of the Company\u2019s employee base resides outside of its retail banking footprint. Inclusive in the above, as of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 118 international employees based in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Germany and France. The Company\u2019s employee base includes 6,022 employees that support customers in the retail branch network. Overall, the average tenure of the Company\u2019s employees is 9.5 years and the average tenure of the Company\u2019s executive officers is 19.5 years.\n\n18\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTalent Attraction and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nThe Company leverages various channels to effectively identify, develop and recruit high-caliber talent throughout its footprint including its current employee base. The Employee Referral Program is a powerful tool for generating applicants and accounted for 23% of new hires in 2022. In addition, the Company\u2019s Talent Acquisition Ambassador Program, which was implemented in 2020 and currently includes 48 employees throughout different business lines, dedicated over 800 hours towards promoting awareness of M&T career opportunities within the Company\u2019s communities.\n\nThe Company\u2019s recruitment team strives to create and maintain diverse representation at all levels and in all areas of the organization to promote a sense of belonging among employees and maintain a workforce that reflects the communities the Company serves. Employees attended 70 individual diversity-based recruiting events in 2022 with target audiences crossing many diversity dimensions, such as people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+, individuals with disabilities and women. The Company also works with diversity-focused schools and organizations as part of its efforts to recruit and maintain a diverse workforce. In 2022, 45% of total corporate hires were people of color and 61% were women, 40% of summer interns were people of color, and 53% of the participants in the Company\u2019s Technology Internship Program were people of color. As of December 31, 2022, the entire Company\u2019s workforce consisted of approximately 60% women and 27% people of color. This year, M&T also partnered with the Department of Defense to further the development of two programs focused on providing active members approaching the end of their service with civilian work experience, industry training, and career development opportunities, post military.\n\nTo further drive diversity within the Company, M&T also supports several employee resource group charters and chapters, which are voluntary, employee-driven groups organized around a particular shared interest and characteristic, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or differing abilities. Approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s employees and 46% of managers are involved in these groups. The Company\u2019s diversity efforts are led by its Chief Diversity Officer, who is a member of senior leadership, and the Senior Leadership Diversity & Inclusion Council, both of which champion inclusion efforts throughout the Company. M&T\u2019s Board of Directors also receives regular updates on the Company\u2019s diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEngagement and Development\n\nM&T\u2019s commitment to recruiting top talent and regularly soliciting their feedback helps to create a highly engaged employee base that drives the Company\u2019s success. Since 2001, the Company has conducted 17 \u201cEngagement Surveys,\u201d with average participation rates above 90%, demonstrating a commitment to fostering candid, open and honest two-way communication with employees to enhance the workplace. All survey results are reviewed with senior management and shared with individual managers, who identify and implement improvements based on employees\u2019 feedback, as well as presented to M&T's Board of Directors. Employees also participate in action planning within individual work groups. In addition, M&T conducts other surveys to monitor and guide the employee experience throughout an employee\u2019s time with the Company. Surveys are conducted at various times, such as new hire onboarding or separation from the Company, as well as in connection with key events, such as acquisitions.\n\nThe Company also encourages engagement with communities through the allotment of 40 hours of paid volunteer time. In 2022, M&T employees volunteered approximately 159,000 hours and served on the boards of 831 non-profit organizations.\n\n19\n\n---\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother key pillar of engagement, employee development and growth, is fostered through the Company's strong performance management philosophy focused on reinforcing corporate values, providing continuous, transparent feedback and recognizing and rewarding outstanding performance. Additional employee development is cultivated through a variety of learning offerings on topics such as technical skills, job-specific knowledge and professional development, including courses aligned with the Company's enterprise-wide leadership competencies. Training content is made available as synchronous, asynchronous, and blended learning solutions to promote employee access. The Company also invests in creating its leaders of tomorrow through various internal programs including its Manager Acceleration Program, Management Development Program, Executive Associate Program, Technology Development Program and two additional programs focused on the Company's high-performing diverse employees - the Rising Leadership Development Program and Equity One.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCompensation, Health and Wellness\n\nThe Company provides comprehensive compensation and benefits programs intended to attract, retain and incentivize its employees. In addition to base pay, these programs (which vary by country and region) include cash incentives, long term equity-based awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, parental leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs and tuition assistance, among others. Over the past year, the Company has also implemented an educational program to provide transparency to employees around the different processes completed to ensure fair and equitable compensation for all team members.\n\nThe Company\u2019s wellness programs provide employees and their families with resources that may be helpful in navigating life events and are designed to provide support to help improve their well-being. In addition to addressing employees\u2019 physical needs through flexible and convenient medical plan and telemedicine options, M&T supports employees\u2019 emotional health and social well-being through various programs offered to employees. The Company joins with several of its medical partners to offer sponsored events and courses, led by medical experts, and also works to help employees manage their financial wellness through free educational resources.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company faces extensive and intensive competition in the products and services it offers. The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial and wealth services with other banking institutions and thrifts and with firms in a number of other industries, such as credit unions, personal loan companies, sales finance companies, leasing companies, securities brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, wealth and investment advisory firms, insurance companies and other financial services-related entities. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis. Financial technology companies, using digital, mobile and other technologies, also are increasingly offering traditional banking products and services, which has resulted in the Company contending with a broader range of competitors, including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of the Company\u2019s banking office network.\n\nOther Information\n\nThrough a link on the Investor Relations section of M&T\u2019s website at www.mtb.com, copies of M&T\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC.
