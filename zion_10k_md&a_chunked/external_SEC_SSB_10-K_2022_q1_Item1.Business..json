We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association (the \u201cBank\u201d), a national banking association, from our headquarters branch in Winter Haven, Florida and, as of December\u00a031, 2021, a 281-branch network located throughout Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.

We do not engage in any significant operations other than the ownership of our banking subsidiary.\n\nThrough the Bank, we operate a correspondent banking and capital markets service division for over 1,060 small and medium sized community financial institutions throughout the United States. Based primarily in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama, this division earns commissions on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, which offers support to the Bank\u2019s Wealth line of business.\n\nIn February 2021, the Bank completed its acquisition of Duncan-Williams, Inc., a full-service broker dealer that is being integrated into our correspondent division due to the complementary nature of its capital markets business (\u201cDWI\u201d). The Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (\u201cCBI\u201d), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (\u201cCorporate Billing\u201d), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide.\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2021, we had approximately $42.0\u00a0billion in assets, $23.9\u00a0billion in loans, $35.1\u00a0billion in deposits, $4.8\u00a0billion in shareholders\u2019 equity, and a market capitalization of approximately $5.6\u00a0billion.\n\nOn June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CenterState Bank Corporation of Winter Haven, Florida (\u201cCSFL\u201d), the holding company for CenterState Bank, N.A. (\u201cCSB\u201d), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the \u201cCenterState Merger\u201d), and (ii) immediately following the CenterState Merger, South State Bank, a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned bank subsidiary of the Company merged with and into CenterState Bank, National Association (\u201cCSB\u201d), a national banking association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of CSFL, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank (the \u201cCenterState Bank Merger\u201d).
