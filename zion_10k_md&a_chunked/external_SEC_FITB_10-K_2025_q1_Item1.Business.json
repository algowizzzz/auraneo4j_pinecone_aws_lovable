As of December\u00a031, 2024, Fifth Third had $213 billion in assets and operates 1,089 full-service Banking Centers and 2,080 Fifth Third branded ATMs in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The Bancorp operates three main businesses: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth\u00a0and Asset Management. Fifth Third is among the largest money managers in the Midwest and, as of December\u00a031, 2024, had $634 billion in assets under care, of which it managed $69 billion for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations. Investor information and press releases can be viewed on the Bancorp\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.53.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Website references in this Annual Report are merely textual references. Fifth Third\u2019s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ\u00ae Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cFITB.\u201d\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial products and services to the commercial, financial, retail, governmental, educational, energy and healthcare sectors. This includes a variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, wealth management solutions, payments and commerce solutions, securities products and services, insurance services and credit products such as commercial loans and leases, mortgage loans, credit cards, installment loans and other lending products. These products and services are delivered through a variety of channels including the Bancorp\u2019s banking centers, other offices, telephone sales, the internet and mobile applications. The Bank has deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d). Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as an attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of subsidiaries of the Bancorp as of February 15, 2025.\n\nAdditional information regarding the Bancorp\u2019s businesses is included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nAvailability of Financial Information\n\nThe Bancorp files reports with the SEC. Those reports include the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and annual proxy statement, as well as any amendments to those reports. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The Bancorp\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, annual proxy statement and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are accessible at no cost on the Bancorp\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.53.com on a same day basis after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nInformation about the Bancorp\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (as amended from time to time), is available on Fifth Third\u2019s corporate website at www.53.com. In addition, any future waivers from a provision of the Fifth Third Code of Business Conduct and Ethics covering any of Fifth Third\u2019s directors or executive officers (including Fifth Third\u2019s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller) will be posted at this internet address.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Bancorp, primarily through the Bank, competes for deposits, loans and other banking services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to traditional banking institutions, the Bancorp competes with securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, specialty finance, private credit, financial technology and insurance companies. These companies compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers with meaningful alternatives to traditional banking services in nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. These competitive trends are likely to continue.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s human capital strategy is designed to attract, develop and retain talent. This strategy ensures that Fifth Third has the talent, capabilities and organizational structure to support business needs now and in the future. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Bancorp had 18,616 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 18,724 as of December\u00a031, 2023. These employees support the organization\u2019s ambition and purpose by upholding its values by committing to excellence, being connected and acting with creativity and courage. Fifth Third is committed to living its values, serving its customers, delivering financial performance and being recognized as a leader in building an engaging workplace.\n\n16 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nEngagement and Development\n\nFifth Third believes that an engaged workforce is one of its most valuable assets in sustaining its success. The Bancorp\u2019s continuous listening strategy is an important component of its inclusive culture. The Bancorp\u2019s holistic approach to collecting, measuring and responding to employee feedback enhances the employee experience at critical points during times of change in business or work environments. Feedback is collected through a variety of methods, including the Employee Viewpoints Survey, which includes questions related to culture, engagement, inclusion, employee well-being, expectations and intent to stay.\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s learning, development and career mobility strategy delivers personalized and accessible experiences that fuel career growth and help retain talent. In response to employee feedback, Fifth Third continued its focus on career mobility with enhanced tools to support internal career pathing. This includes a robust suite of learning resources covering several areas, including leadership and professional development to foster learning and career advancement across the employee population. In 2024, employees engaged in over 255,000 hours of discretionary learning.\n\nSeveral new initiatives were introduced, including a comprehensive onboarding program for new managers, a high performing program for senior leaders, and new offerings aimed at developing the professional and leadership skills necessary to build a strong pipeline of leaders. Fifth Third leaders engaged in 2,800 different development offerings. Fifth Third\u2019s commitment to compliance and risk management also remains strong, with all employees and contingent workers completing more than 475,000 course hours on these topics.\n\nTotal Rewards \u2013 Compensation and Benefits\n\nThe Bancorp is committed to providing competitive compensation programs that attract and retain top talent, while driving the business strategy and effectively managing risk. Fifth Third\u2019s compensation programs are designed to reward performance and align with regulatory expectations while reflecting the Bancorp\u2019s values and behavioral standards. The Bancorp\u2019s compensation philosophy is centered on creating long-term shareholder value.\n\nFifth Third continuously analyzes its compensation programs to ensure all employees have equal opportunities to maximize their potential. Fifth Third\u2019s comprehensive benefits program is designed to address the personal and professional needs of employees and their families. In addition to traditional benefits offerings, the Bancorp provides comprehensive support with unique programs focused on the financial, physical, emotional and social well-being of employees.\n\nRecruitment and Retention\n\nThe Bancorp continues to navigate the changing talent landscape by monitoring the external environment and adapting talent strategies to meet internal needs. The Bancorp\u2019s focus on its employee value proposition demonstrates a continued commitment to employees by developing great leaders and evolving the employee experience. Full year turnover improved, decreasing from 16.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024.\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s recruitment strategies enhance the organization by promoting an inclusive culture. To attract the most talented employees, the Bancorp continues to enhance relationships with universities and partner organizations to attract top talent. Creating and developing an inclusive workforce is important for the Bancorp\u2019s business growth, leading to enhanced innovation while focusing on the needs of its customers.\n\nAcquisitions and Investments\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding its presence in high-growth markets and broadening its product offerings. In order to take into account the integration and other risks, the Bancorp conducts due diligence to evaluate and identify the risks associated with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations regarding acquisitions and investments may take place and future transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of tangible book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.\n\n17 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nRegulation and Supervision\n\nIn addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies (such as the Bank and the Bancorp) by bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the protection of shareholders or debtholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to an extensive regulatory framework of complex and comprehensive federal and state laws and regulations addressing the provision of banking and other financial services and other aspects of the Bancorp\u2019s businesses and operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) and legislation modifying Dodd-Frank, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), will continue to impact the Bancorp and the Bank. To the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. While the regulatory environment has recently been in a period of rebalancing, the Bancorp expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\n\nThe EGRRCPA amended various sections of Dodd-Frank, including section 165, which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for BHCs. The EGRRCPA\u2019s increased asset thresholds took effect immediately for BHCs with total consolidated assets less than $100\u00a0billion, with the exception of risk committee requirements, which now apply to publicly traded BHCs with $50\u00a0billion or more of consolidated assets. BHCs with consolidated assets between $100\u00a0billion and $250\u00a0billion, including the Bancorp, were subject to the enhanced prudential standards that applied to them before enactment of EGRRCPA until December\u00a031, 2019, when rules adopted by the FRB that tailor the applicability of enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements for BHCs with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets became effective, as described in detail below.\n\nSubsequent to the EGRRCPA, the FRB adopted a rule that adjusts the thresholds at which certain enhanced prudential standards (\u201cEPS\u201d) apply to BHCs with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets (the \u201cEPS Tailoring Rule\u201d) and the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and FDIC adopted a rule that similarly adjusts the thresholds at which certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to BHCs and banks with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets (the \u201cCapital and Liquidity Tailoring Rule\u201d and, together with the EPS Tailoring Rule, the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The Tailoring Rules establish four risk-based categories of institutions, and the extent to which enhanced prudential standards and certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to these BHCs and banks depends on the banking organization\u2019s category. Under the Tailoring Rules, the Bancorp and the Bank each qualify as a Category IV banking organization subject to the least restrictive of the requirements applicable to firms with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets.\n\nRegulators\n\nThe Bancorp and/or the Bank are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) and the OCC and additionally by certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory organizations. The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the nature of some of its businesses. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank\u2019s deposits as permitted by law.\n\nThe federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks and to BHCs regulate, among other matters, the scope of the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s businesses, their activities, their investments, their capital and liquidity levels, their ability to make capital distributions (such as share repurchases and dividends), their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, the amount of and collateral for certain loans and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans, as applicable. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations also affect the services provided to consumers.\n\nThe Bancorp and the Bank are required to file various reports with and are subject to examination by various regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. The FRB, the OCC and the CFPB have the authority to issue orders for BHCs and banks to cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. Some of the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals in certain situations, such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation. Applicable state and federal laws also grant the Bancorp\u2019s regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and the Bank and, in some situations, the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information.\n\nThe following discussion describes certain elements of the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. This discussion is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to the Bancorp, the Bank and the Bancorp\u2019s other subsidiaries.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB for a BHC to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, BHC or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any BHC.\n\n18 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nThe BHCA generally prohibits a BHC from engaging in, or acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a BHC that engages directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its banking subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto.\n\nFinancial Holding Companies\n\nThe Bancorp is registered as a BHC with the FRB under the BHCA and qualifies for and has elected to become an FHC. An FHC is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. Permitted activities for an FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be \u201cfinancial in nature or incidental thereto\u201d or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to financial activities. In addition, an FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become an FHC if the BHC is well-capitalized and is well managed and each of its banking subsidiaries is well-capitalized, is well managed and has at least a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d). To maintain FHC status, a BHC must continue to meet these requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the FHC and may also adversely affect the FHC\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions (including mergers and acquisitions) or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may not necessarily be available to the public.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Bank, to fund its activities, including its ability to make capital distributions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Under federal law, there are various limitations on the extent to which the Bank can declare and pay dividends to the Bancorp, including those related to regulatory capital requirements, general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits, surplus and available earnings. Certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Bancorp. No assurances can be given that the Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to the Bancorp.\n\nThe Bancorp\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and FRB regulations and policy. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a BHC\u2019s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Bancorp\u2019s ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing shares, is subject to the Bancorp complying with the automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the FRBs \u201cCapital Rules\u201d process discussed below (see Regulatory Capital Requirements below).\n\nSource of Strength\n\nA BHC, including the Bancorp, is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of the Bancorp or its shareholders or creditors. United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) banking regulators may require a BHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the BHC fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize the BHC\u2019s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank.\n\nUnder these requirements, the Bancorp may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by the Bancorp to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of the Bancorp\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Bancorp to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\n\nFDIC Assessments\n\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor per account ownership category per bank and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The Bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the DIF and, therefore, must pay insurance premiums. The FDIC may increase the Bank\u2019s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC\u2019s assessment of its risk profile.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30%, below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve\n\n19 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nratio would be restored to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2028. The FDIC\u2019s amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, which began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023.\n\nIn response to the bank failures that occurred in the first half of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule for a special deposit insurance assessment on banking organizations with greater than $5 billion in assets to recover the losses to the DIF associated with protecting uninsured depositors. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Bancorp\u2019s estimate of its allocation of the special assessment was $252 million, based on the most recent information provided by the FDIC. As a result of this special assessment, the Bancorp recorded expense of $28 million and $224 million during the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to this estimate. The Bancorp currently expects to pay the special assessment to the FDIC over a total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began with the first quarter of 2024. The estimate of the cost associated with protecting the uninsured depositors will continue to be subject to periodic adjustment until the final loss amount is determined by the FDIC.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates\n\nFederal banking laws restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including a parent BHC. The Bank is subject to these restrictions, which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank. Generally, a bank\u2019s covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus. Dodd-Frank expanded the scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nThe CRA generally requires insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities. The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate the performance of national banks (including the Bank) with respect to these CRA obligations. Depository institutions must maintain comprehensive records of their CRA activities for purposes of these examinations. The OCC must take into account the institution\u2019s record of performance in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. For purposes of CRA examinations, the OCC rates each institution\u2019s compliance with the CRA as \u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d The Bank\u2019s most recently received CRA performance rating from the OCC was Outstanding.\n\nThe CRA requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a bank\u2019s CRA assessment when considering the bank\u2019s application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office. The FRB also must consider the CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a BHC in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the BHC. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by the Bancorp or the Bank.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the OCC, FRB and FDIC issued a final rule to modernize their respective CRA regulations. The revised rules substantially alter the methodology for assessing compliance with the CRA, with material aspects taking effect January 1, 2026 and revised data reporting requirements taking effect January 1, 2027. Among other things, the revised rules evaluate lending outside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile banking, apply a metrics-based benchmarking approach to assessment and clarify eligible CRA activities. The revised CRA regulations have been subject to an injunction since March 29, 2024. The effective dates will be extended for each day the injunction remains in place, pending the resolution of the lawsuit.\n\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe Bancorp and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the capital adequacy rules (the \u201cCapital Rules\u201d) adopted by the FRB, for the Bancorp, and by the OCC, for the Bank. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the FRB and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Bancorp\u2019s operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bancorp\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications. Under the Capital Rules, the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s assets, exposures and certain\u00a0off-balance\u00a0sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions\u2019 risk-weighted assets pursuant to the federal banking agencies\u2019 Standardized Approach to risk-weighting of assets. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for the Bancorp and the Bank:\n\n\u2022Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders\u2019 equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d). The Bancorp has elected to exclude certain AOCI components, with the result that those components are not recognized in the Bancorp\u2019s CET1. The FDIC, FRB and OCC have jointly issued rules for institutions that do not apply advanced approaches to regulatory capital, including the\n\n20 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nBancorp and the Bank. These rules simplified the capital treatment of certain items (including mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions) and simplified the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital. The advanced approaches to regulatory capital are generally required for large, internationally active banking organizations including those designated as global systemically important BHCs and those with total assets or cross-jurisdictional activity in excess of certain thresholds.\n\n\u2022Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d). Tier 2 capital also includes, among other things, certain trust preferred securities.\n\n\u2022Leverage Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions).\n\nUnder the Capital Rules, an institution\u2019s eligible retained income, when considered in conjunction with capital ratios and the stress capital buffer, provides limitations on capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) and certain executive compensation arrangements for the quarter following the calculation. As of December 31, 2024, the Bancorp was not subject to these limitations.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Bancorp elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of ASU 2016-13 (\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (\u201cmodified CECL transitional amount\u201d) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (\u201cCECL transitional amount\u201d) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount was then fixed as of December 31, 2021 and that amount is subject to the three-year phase out. Refer to the Capital Management section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.\n\nThe Capital Rules also require banking organizations to maintain a stress capital buffer to avoid becoming subject to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers (see Stress Buffer Requirements below). For more information related to the stress capital buffer, refer to Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe total minimum regulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below. The FRB has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the Capital Rules. For purposes of the FRB\u2019s Regulation Y, including determining whether a BHC meets the requirements to be an FHC, BHCs, such as the Bancorp, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater. If the FRB were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as that applicable to the Bank, the Bancorp\u2019s capital ratios as of December\u00a031, 2024 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The FRB may require BHCs, including the Bancorp, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a BHC\u2019s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.\n\nThe following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios, minimum ratio plus stress capital buffer and well-capitalized minimums compared with the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios as of December\u00a031, 2024:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Regulatory Capital Ratios: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Minimum\u00a0Regulatory Capital Ratio | | |  | | | Minimum\u00a0Ratio\u00a0+ Stress Capital Buffer(a) | | |  | | | Well-Capitalized Minimums(b) | | |  | | | Actual at  December\u00a031, 2024 | | |\n| CET1 risk-based capital ratio: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Fifth Third Bancorp | | | 4.50 | | % |  | | | 7.70 | |  |  | | | N/A | | |  | | | 10.57 | |  |\n| Fifth Third Bank, National Association | | | 4.50 | |  |  | | | 7.70 | |  |  | | | 6.50 | |  |  | | | 12.86 | |  |\n| Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Fifth Third Bancorp | | | 6.00 | |  |  | | | 9.20 | |  |  | | | 6.00 | |  |  | | | 11.86 | |  |\n| Fifth Third Bank, National Association | | | 6.00 | |  |  | | | 9.20 | |  |  | | | 8.00 | |  |  | | | 12.86 | |  |\n| Total risk-based capital ratio: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Fifth Third Bancorp | | | 8.00 | |  |  | | | 11.20 | |  |  | | | 10.00 | |  |  | | | 13.86 | |  |\n| Fifth Third Bank, National Association | | | 8.00 | |  |  | | | 11.20 | |  |  | | | 10.00 | |  |  | | | 14.19 | |  |\n| Leverage ratio: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Fifth Third Bancorp | | | 4.00 | |  |  | | | N/A | | |  | | | N/A | | |  | | | 9.22 | |  |\n| Fifth Third Bank, National Association | | | 4.00 | |  |  | | | N/A | | |  | | | 5.00 | |  |  | | | 10.02 | |  |\n\n(a)Reflects the stress capital buffer of 3.2% as of December 31, 2024.\n\n(b)Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bancorp under FRB Regulation Y and the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bank.\n\n21 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nThe FRB\u2019s capital plan rule requires BHCs with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including the Bancorp, to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the BHC\u2019s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the BHC\u2019s process for assessing capital adequacy and the BHC\u2019s capital policy.\n\nThe FRB annually evaluates capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes and capital distribution plans of BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The evaluation process is intended to help ensure that those BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company\u2019s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress.\n\nIn March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule to integrate the annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements for large BHCs. As a result, the FRB\u2019s supervisory stress test process is now used to calibrate the stress capital buffer requirement for large BHCs. As a result of the EPS Tailoring Rule, Category IV BHCs, including the Bancorp, are no longer required to conduct and disclose the results of company-run stress tests and are subject to the supervisory stress test process every two years. The Bancorp\u2019s most recent required assessment was completed in 2024. These supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp\u2019s capital.\n\nStress Buffer Requirements\n\nThe Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp\u2019s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp\u2019s stress capital buffer under the FRB severely adverse scenario was 3.2% as of December 31, 2024 and 2.5% as of December 31, 2023. The Bancorp\u2019s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\n\nPursuant to Title I of Dodd-Frank, certain U.S. BHCs are subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements. As a result, the Bancorp is subject to more stringent standards, including liquidity and capital requirements, leverage limits, stress testing, resolution planning and risk management standards, than those applicable to smaller institutions. Certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards.\n\nAs discussed above, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp, as a Category IV banking organization, is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets. As compared to enhanced prudential standards that were applicable to the Bancorp, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements and is subject to less frequent supervisory stress tests, less frequent internal liquidity stress tests and reduced liquidity risk management requirements.\n\nHeightened Governance and Risk Management Standards\n\nThe OCC has published guidelines documenting expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including the Bank. The guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions\u2019 boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. The Bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls.\n\nPrivacy and Data Security\n\nThe OCC, FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the OCC, FRB and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity through guidance, examinations and regulations. The Bancorp has adopted an information security program that has been approved by the Bancorp\u2019s Board of Directors. For more information related to cybersecurity, refer to Part I, Item 1C of this report.\n\nThe GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary\u2019s policies and procedures. The Bancorp\u2019s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. The Bancorp continues to assess the requirements of such laws and proposed legislation and their applicability to the Bancorp.\n\n22 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nMoreover, these laws, and proposed legislation, are still subject to revision or formal guidance and they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our understanding.\n\nLike other lenders, the Bank and other of the Bancorp\u2019s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Bancorp and its subsidiaries.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions\n\nThe Bancorp is subject to federal laws that are designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and transactions with certain persons, companies or foreign governments sanctioned by the U.S. These include the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and regulations for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws obligate depository institutions and broker-dealers to verify their customers\u2019 identity, conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of transactions in currency and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts. They also prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain designated restricted countries and persons. Depository institutions and broker-dealers are required by their federal regulators to maintain robust policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with these obligations.\n\nFailure to comply with these laws or maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring or other expansionary activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to these laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. The Bancorp\u2019s Board has approved policies and procedures that the Bancorp believes comply with these laws.\n\nDebit Card Interchange Fees\n\nDodd-Frank includes a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. Interchange fees for electronic debit transactions are limited to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction, plus an additional one cent per transaction fraud adjustment. These rules impose requirements regarding routing and exclusivity of electronic debit transactions, and generally require that debit cards be usable in at least two unaffiliated networks. On October 25, 2023, the FRB proposed to lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. The proposal would also establish a regular process for updating the maximum amount every other year going forward. Fifth Third continues to monitor the development of these proposed rule revisions.\n\nResolution Planning\n\nThe FRB and FDIC have previously required certain BHCs and banking institutions to periodically submit resolution plans discussing how a company or institution could be rapidly and orderly resolved in the event of material financial distress or failure. The Bancorp, as a BHC with less than $250 billion of assets, is no longer subject to the FRB\u2019s resolution plan requirements. However, the Bank is still subject to resolution planning requirements enacted by the FDIC. The FDIC\u2019s resolution planning requirements were temporarily suspended in April 2019 as the FDIC requested comments on how to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm\u2019s size, complexity and risk profile. In 2021, the FDIC provided implementation guidance on certain aspects of its resolution plan rule and the Bank submitted a resolution plan to the FDIC by the December 1, 2022 deadline, as required under that guidance. In June 2024, the FDIC board approved a final rule to amend its resolution plan requirements that largely apply to insured depository institutions with more than $100 billion in assets, including the Bank. This rule requires submission of comprehensive resolution plans that meet enhanced standards every three years, and interim submissions in intervening years. The final rule took effect on October 1, 2024, and the Bank\u2019s first submission under the new requirements is due on or before July 1, 2025.\n\nRecovery Planning\n\nOn October 21, 2024, the OCC amended its enforceable Recovery Planning Guidelines to apply to banks with at least $100 billion in assets, such as the Bank, effective January 1, 2025, subject to a twelve-month compliance period. Broadly, the guidelines require a recovery plan that includes indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that reflect the Bank\u2019s particular vulnerabilities, credible options the Bank could undertake in response to restore its financial strength and viability and an assessment and description of how these options would affect the Bank. Recovery plans must also address overall organizational and legal entity structure and related interconnections and interdependencies, procedures for escalating decision-making, management reports, communication procedures and any other information the OCC requires.\n\nRegulatory Regime for Derivatives\n\nTitle VII of Dodd-Frank imposes a registration regime and regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital margin, segregation trade reporting, position limits, business conduct standards and recordkeeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a swap dealer or a security-based swap dealer. The Bank is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. The CFTC, SEC and U.S. banking regulators have finalized the rules implementing Title VII applicable to the over-the-counter derivatives markets and swap dealers. As a CFTC registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to the requirements of Title\n\n23 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)\n\nVII, including rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting, recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps and trade documentation and confirmation requirements. In addition, the U.S. banking regulators have finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting, collection and segregation of margin by certain swap counterparties and capital requirements. The Bank is not registered as a security-based swap dealer.\n\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\n\nFifth Third\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC. Financial Industry Regulation Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) is the primary self-regulatory organization for Fifth Third\u2019s registered broker-dealer subsidiary. Fifth Third\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA considers a variety of factors in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\n\nConsumer Protection Regulation and Supervision\n\nThe Bancorp is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws. The Bancorp is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under Dodd-Frank, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services.\n\nThe CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related final rules since it was established under Dodd-Frank, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. The mortgage-related final rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the U.S. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Bancorp.\n\nFuture Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives\n\nFederal and state legislators as well as regulatory agencies may introduce or enact new laws and rules, or amend existing laws and rules, that may affect the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The regulatory agencies may seek to apply higher standards to the Bancorp and the Bank than as required by law, through supervision. The impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes, or supervisory direction, cannot be predicted. However, such changes could affect the Bancorp\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n24 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#i4833cf6097c24fb59c49bcfe48f60cfd_52)"
