We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2023, served by 407 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.\n\nWe conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For more information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) on page 42 and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nWe focus on serving customers in the communities in which we operate. Our experienced bankers strive to develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Some of the products and services we provide, whether delivered digitally or by other means, include:\n\n\u2022Commercial and small business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses. Products and services we provide to our commercial and small business banking customers include:\n\n\u25e6Commercial and industrial and owner-occupied lending and leasing;\n\n\u25e6Municipal and public finance services;\n\n\u25e6Depository account and cash management services;\n\n5\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\u25e6Commercial and small business cards, as well as merchant processing services;\n\n\u25e6Corporate trust services; and\n\n\u25e6Correspondent banking and international lending services.\n\n\u2022Capital markets and investment banking. We provide customized financing solutions to help our customers raise capital efficiently, execute strategic transactions, and manage exposure to financial markets. Capital markets products and services include:\n\n\u25e6Loan syndications;\n\n\u25e6Foreign exchange services and interest rate derivatives;\n\n\u25e6Fixed income securities underwriting;\n\n\u25e6Advisory and capital raising;\n\n\u25e6Commercial mortgage-backed security (\u201cCMBS\u201d) conduit lending; and\n\n\u25e6Power and project financing.\n\n\u2022Commercial real estate lending. We provide lending products secured by commercial real estate to borrowers that include:\n\n\u25e6Term and construction/land development financing, including the following collateral types:\n\n\u25aaCommercial multi-family, industrial, and office; and\n\n\u25aaResidential single-family, community development, and affordable housing.\n\n\u2022Retail banking.

Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.\n\nOur key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.\n\n6\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nThe banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.\n\nThe National Bank Act\n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.\n\nThe National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.\n\nCapital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.\n\nUnder the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.\n\nAn institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.\n\nThe following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:\n\nSchedule 1\n\nMINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | |\n|  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % |\n| Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  |\n| Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  |\n| Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |\n\nRecent Regulatory Developments\n\nBasel III Endgame\n\nOn July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nUnder the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.\n\nLong-term Debt\n\nOn August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.\n\nResolution Planning\n\nAdditionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nWe utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.\n\nLiquidity\n\nWe utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.\n\n9\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nFinancial Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\nThe federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\n\nFederal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.\n\nOther Regulations and Proposals\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.\n\n\u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.\n\n\u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.\n\n\u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.\n\n\u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.\n\n\u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).\n\n\u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.\n\n10\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.\n\n\u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.\n\n\u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n\u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.\n\n\u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.\n\nWe are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.\n\nSustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.\n\nIn addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.\n\n11\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more health care plan alternatives, and greater access to mental health benefits.\n\nWe had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our workforce as self-identified by our employees:\n\nSchedule 2\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | |\n| Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Management | | | 52% | | |  | | | 29% | | |  | | | 9% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n| Non-management | | | 60% | | |  | | | 40% | | |  | | | 10% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n| All employees | | | 58% | | |  | | | 38% | | |  | | | 10% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n\nThe following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:\n\nCultivating an environment where people are respected and valued, and where individual and cultural differences are embraced\n\nWe believe that (1) our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees, and (2) in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture while still offering flexibility to balance personal needs.\n\n12\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe endeavor to provide opportunities for growth, development, and leadership to every employee. We are committed to continue this focus on ensuring that we have a workplace where all are treated fairly in accordance with their qualifications and abilities, and that the Bank is a place where everyone counts.\n\nWe strive to build a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structures. Our Everyone Counts Council coordinates the related efforts of our affiliates and enterprise groups, and advises executive management on goals and recommendations for ongoing improvement. Our efforts include employee business forums, mental health initiatives, and a broad range of employee and regional events. Throughout the organization, the employee business forums foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and connections to the communities in which we operate.\n\nWe use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.\n\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success\n\nWe are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.\n\nConsistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.\n\nWe are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.\n\nRecognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees\n\nOur comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.\n\nWe routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.\n\nOur employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups.
