    "text": "General\n\nCommerce Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, was incorporated under the laws of Missouri on August 4, 1966. Through a second tier wholly-owned bank holding company, it owns all the outstanding capital stock of Commerce Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), which is headquartered in Missouri. The Bank engages in general banking business, providing a broad range of retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to individuals and businesses. Commerce Bancshares, Inc. also owns, directly or through the Bank, various non-banking subsidiaries. Their activities include private equity investment, securities brokerage, insurance agency, specialty lending, and leasing activities. A list of Commerce Bancshares, Inc.'s subsidiaries is included as Exhibit 21.\n\nCommerce Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\") is one of the nation\u2019s top 50 bank holding companies, based on asset size. At December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had consolidated assets of $31.9 billion, loans of $16.3 billion, deposits of $26.2 billion, and equity of $2.5 billion. The Company's principal markets, which are served by 148 branch facilities, are located throughout Missouri, Kansas, and central Illinois, as well as Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado. Its two largest markets are St. Louis and Kansas City, which serve as central hubs for the Company. The Company also has offices in Dallas, Houston, Cincinnati, Nashville, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids that support customers in its commercial and/or wealth segments and operates a commercial payments business with sales representatives covering the continental United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d).\n\nThe Company\u2019s goal is to be the preferred provider of financial services in its communities, based on strong customer relationships built through providing top quality service with a strong risk management culture, and employing a strong balance sheet with strong capital levels. The Company operates under a super-community banking format which incorporates large bank product offerings coupled with deep local market knowledge, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select, critical areas. The Company\u2019s focus on local markets is supported by an experienced team of bankers assigned to each market coupled with industry specialists. The Company also uses regional advisory boards, comprised of local business leaders, professionals and other community representatives, who assist the Company in responding to local banking needs. In addition to this local market, community-based focus, the Company offers sophisticated financial products usually only available at much larger financial institutions.\n\nThe markets the Bank serves are mainly located in the lower Midwest, which provides natural sites for production and distribution facilities and serve as transportation hubs. The economy has been well-diversified in these markets with many major industries represented, including telecommunications, automobile, technology, financial services, aircraft and general manufacturing, health care, numerous service industries, and food and agricultural production. The personal real estate lending operations of the Bank are predominantly centered in its lower Midwestern markets.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company evaluates the potential acquisition of various financial institutions. In addition, the Company regularly considers the purchase and disposition of real estate assets and branch locations. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and either possess significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company has not completed any bank acquisitions since 2013.\n\nEmployees and Human Capital\n\nThe Company employed 4,447 persons on a full-time basis and 151 persons on a part-time basis at December\u00a031, 2022. None of the Company's employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nAttracting and retaining talented team members is key to the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy and compete effectively. The Company values the unique combination of talents and experiences each team member contributes toward the Company\u2019s success and strives to offer rewards that meet team members\u2019 individual, evolving needs. Well-being is much more than a paycheck and that\u2019s why the Company takes a comprehensive approach to Total Rewards, supporting team members\u2019 physical well-being, financial well-being, and emotional well-being and career development. The Company\u2019s financial well-being program includes a company-matching 401(k) plan and health savings accounts, educational and adoption assistance programs. Emotional well-being programs include paid time off, an employee assistance program (EAP) and company-paid membership to Care.com. Physical well-being is supported by the Company\u2019s health, dental, vision, life and various other insurances, and a wellness program that incentivizes team members to live a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Career development is also a key component of the Company\u2019s Total Rewards, and the Company has a variety of programs to support team members as they continue to grow within their current role or develop for their next role. Job shadowing, leadership\n\n3\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)\n\ndevelopment programs, Aspiring Managers program, Managing at Commerce, competency assessments and education assistance are just a few of the ways the Company helps team members excel.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company focused efforts on providing team members support and resources to navigate the ever-changing environment. Initiatives included routine communications providing relevant updates and information, resources for leaders to help keep their teams engaged and connected, new resources for working parents, and access to emotional support resources. The Company implemented a phased-in approach to returning to on-site work and created more flexible work categories for team members to provide for ongoing flexibility. While the most significant impacts of the pandemic appear to have passed, the Company continues to provide most of its team members flexible work schedules.\n\nThe Company believes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) builds stronger companies with better results. In 2022, the Company\u2019s efforts continued around a key initiative focusing on DEI through the lens of our workforce, our suppliers, our community and our customers. Internal teams continue to iterate to build plans for growth in all four areas. The Company continues to build a sense of belonging by engaging team members in a variety of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to support its diverse workforce. RISE (empowering women), EMERGE (connecting young professionals), VIBE (valuing multicultural perspectives), PRIDE (engaging the LGBTQIA+ community), and SALUTE (supporting veterans) are important forums that provide team members opportunities to connect, learn, and encourage diverse perspectives. Participation in these ERGs is voluntary, and more than 40% of team members belong to one of these groups. Other internal DEI efforts have included unconscious bias training, book clubs, listen, talk, and learn sessions, courageous conversation training, mentoring programs, and review of talent at all levels of the organization. The Company\u2019s longstanding approach of \u201cdoing what\u2019s right\u201d continues to guide its focus on its team members and communities.\n\nThe Company\u2019s robust listening strategy allows it to stay connected to the team member experience to understand the evolving needs of its team members and to focus on what matters most to them. This strategy includes a balance of surveys, focus groups, and one on one conversations to allow for two-way conversation and provides trends over time by key demographics. The Company\u2019s goal is to create a sense of belonging which it believes is connected to high levels of engagement, enablement, retention, and results. The Company\u2019s intentional strategy has allowed it to maintain levels of engagement that have been recognized by its annual survey partner, Korn Ferry, for being \u201cbest-in-class\" and to be recognized by Forbes as one of the best mid-sized employers.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive environment of financial services. The Company regularly faces competition from banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, credit card companies, private equity firms, leasing companies, securities brokers and dealers, financial technology companies, e-commerce companies, investment management companies, and other companies providing financial services. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Some other competitors are significantly larger than the Company, and therefore have greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, higher lending limits, and may offer products and services that the Company does not provide. The Company competes by providing a broad offering of products and services to support the needs of customers, matched with a strong commitment to customer service. The Company also competes based on quality, innovation, convenience, reputation, industry knowledge, and price. In its two largest markets, the Company has approximately 12% of the deposit market share in Kansas City and approximately 8% of the deposit market share in St. Louis.\n\nOperating Segments\n\nThe Company is managed in three operating segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Wealth. The Commercial segment provides a full array of corporate lending, merchant and commercial bank card products, payment solutions, leasing, and international services, as well as business and government deposit, investment, and cash management services. The Consumer segment includes the retail branch network, consumer installment lending, personal mortgage banking, and consumer debit and credit bank card activities. The Wealth segment provides traditional trust and estate planning services, brokerage services, and advisory and discretionary investment portfolio management services to both personal and institutional corporate customers. In 2022, the Commercial, Consumer and Wealth segments contributed 53%, 23% and 24% of total segment pre-tax income, respectively. See the section captioned \"Operating Segments\" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this report and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on operating segments.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nThe Company's operations are affected by federal and state legislative changes, by the U.S. government, and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the numerous states in which they operate. These include, for example, the\n\n4\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)\n\nstatutory minimum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary policies, the U.S. Patriot Act, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state bank regulatory agencies.\n\nSupervision and Regulation\n\nThe following information summarizes existing laws and regulations that materially affect the Company's operations. It does not discuss all provisions of these laws and regulations, and it does not include all laws and regulations that affect the Company presently or may affect the Company in the future.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Company, as a bank holding company, is primarily regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s prior approval is required in any case in which the Company proposes to acquire all or substantially all the assets of any bank, acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. With certain exceptions, the BHC Act also prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any non-banking company. Under the BHC Act, the Company may not engage in any business other than managing and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services to subsidiaries, and may not acquire voting control of non-banking companies unless the Federal Reserve Board determines such businesses and services to be closely related to banking. When reviewing bank acquisition applications for approval, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA). Under the terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income areas. The Bank has a current CRA rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d\n\nThe Company is required to file various reports and additional information with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regularly performs examinations of the Company. The Bank is a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Missouri Division of Finance. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In addition, there are numerous other federal and state laws and regulations which control the activities of the Company, including requirements and limitations relating to capital and reserve requirements, permissible investments and lines of business, transactions with affiliates, loan limits, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of securities, dividend payments, and extensions of credit. The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws designed to protect customers and promote fair lending. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts. If the Company fails to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, it may be subject to civil monetary penalties, imposition of cease and desist orders or other written directives, removal of management and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the preservation of the federal deposit insurance funds. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company\u2019s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to employ assets and maximize income.\n\nIn addition to its regulatory powers, the Federal Reserve Bank affects the conditions under which the Company operates by its influence over the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. government securities and oversees changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, changes in the federal funds rate on overnight inter-bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits in implementing its monetary policy objectives. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits, the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and the level of inflation. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions, most notably on the interest rate environment. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company makes no prediction as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand, or their effect on the financial statements of the Company.\n\nThe financial industry operates under laws and regulations that are under regular review by various agencies and legislatures and are subject to change. The Company currently operates as a bank holding company, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and the Bank qualifies as a financial subsidiary under the GLB Act, which allows it to engage in investment banking, insurance agency, brokerage, and underwriting activities that were not available to banks prior to the GLB Act. The GLB Act also included privacy provisions that limit banks\u2019 abilities to disclose non-public information about customers to non-affiliated entities.\n\n5\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)\n\nThe Company must also comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA is designed to help fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes. Compliance is monitored by the Federal Reserve. The BSA was enacted to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries for, or to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from, criminal activity. Since its passage, the BSA has been amended several times. These amendments include the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 which made money laundering a criminal act, as well as the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 which required regulators to develop enhanced examination procedures and increased examiner training to improve the identification of money laundering schemes in financial institutions.\n\nThe USA PATRIOT Act, established in 2001, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations include significant penalties for non-compliance.\n\nThe Company is subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 (Dodd-Frank Act). Among its many provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act required stress-testing for certain financial services companies and established a new council of \u201csystemic risk\u201d regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which is authorized to supervise certain financial services companies and has responsibility to implement, examine for compliance with, and enforce \u201cFederal consumer financial law.\u201d The Company is subject to examinations by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act, through Title VI, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, placed trading restrictions on financial institutions and separated investment banking, private equity and proprietary trading (hedge fund) sections of financial institutions from their consumer lending arms. The Volcker Rule also restricts financial institutions from investing in and sponsoring certain types of investments.\n\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law which provides a number of limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Notable provisions of the legislation include: an increase in the asset threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion, above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards; an exemption from the Volcker Rule for insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets; modifications to the Liquidity Coverage and Supplementary Leverage ratios; and the elimination of Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests for banks and bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets. Most of these provisions affect institutions larger than the Company, and the Company is not required to prepare stress testing as specified by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nSubsidiary Bank\n\nUnder Federal Reserve policy, the bank holding company, Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (the \"Parent\"), is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support it in circumstances when it might not otherwise do so. In addition, loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\n\nDeposit Insurance\n\nSubstantially all of the deposits held by the Bank are insured up to applicable limits (generally $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category) by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.\u00a0In 2011, the FDIC released a final rule to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that affected deposit insurance assessments.\u00a0Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, removed the upper limit of the designated reserve ratio, required that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and required the FDIC to offset the effect of increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio on depository institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion.\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act provided the FDIC flexibility in the implementation of the increase in the designated reserve ratio and also required that the FDIC redefine the assessment base to average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity.\u00a0 Due to growth in insured deposits during the first half of 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell below statutory minimum of 1.35% on June 30, 2022. The FDIC Board of Directors adopted an Amended Restoration Plan in an effort to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2028. The FDIC Board also increased base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, which takes effect on January 1, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's deposit insurance expense was $10.6 million.\n\n6\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)\n\nPayment of Dividends\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of cash dividends to shareholders by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The principal source of the Parent's cash revenues is cash dividends paid by the Bank. The amount of dividends paid by the Bank in any calendar year is limited to the net profit of the current year combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, and permission must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board for dividends exceeding these amounts. The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by factors such as the maintenance of adequate capital.\n\nCapital Adequacy\n\nThe Company is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to judgments by regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors.\n\nA comprehensive capital framework was established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which was effective for large and internationally active U.S. banks and bank holding companies on January 1, 2015. A key goal of the Basel III framework was to strengthen the capital resources of banking organizations during normal and challenging business environments. Basel III increased minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The rule includes a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer is intended to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Failure to maintain the buffer will result in constraints on dividends, stock repurchases and executive compensation. The rule also adjusted the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. At December\u00a031, 2022, the Company's capital ratios are well in excess of those minimum ratios required by Basel III.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, an insured depository institution generally will be classified as well-capitalized (under the Basel III rules mentioned above) if it has a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d or \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. The Bank has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards.\n\nStress Testing\n\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company performed stress tests as specified by the Federal Reserve requirement and published results beginning in 2014 through 2017. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was enacted, which eliminated the required stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act for banks with consolidated assets of less than $250 billion. The Company continues to perform periodic stress-testing based on its own internal criteria.\n\nExecutive and Incentive Compensation\n\nGuidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice, and describe compensation as \"excessive\" when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. The Federal Reserve Board has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking. This guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, based on key principles that (i) incentives do not\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)\n\nencourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to identify and manage risk, (ii) compensation arrangements are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) compensation arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective board oversight. Deficiencies in compensation practices may affect supervisory ratings and enforcement actions may be taken if incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to safety and soundness.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board regulates transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries.\u00a0Generally, the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, limit the Company\u2019s banking subsidiary and its subsidiaries to lending and other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with affiliates.\u00a0The aggregate amount of covered transactions a banking subsidiary or its subsidiaries may enter into with an affiliate may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary.\n\nCovered transactions with affiliates are also subject to collateralization requirements and must be conducted on arm\u2019s length terms.\u00a0Covered transactions include (a) a loan or extension of credit by the banking subsidiary, including derivative contracts, (b) a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary, (c) a purchase of assets by the banking subsidiary unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve, (d) acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan, and (e) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate.\n\nCertain transactions with the Company's directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations. Among other things, these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals, and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans to related parties.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal offices are located at 1000 Walnut Street, Kansas City, Missouri (telephone number 816-234-2000). The Company makes available free of charge, through its website at www.commercebank.com, reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing. Additionally, a copy of our electronically filed materials can be found at www.sec.gov. These filings include the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Conte](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)[nts](#ifbd75c1343544f90885a3237ef496e2f_7)"
