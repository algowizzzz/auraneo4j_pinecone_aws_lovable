    "text": "Organization\n\nEast West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998, and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of East West Bank (\u201cEast West Bank\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d), which became its principal asset. East West\u2019s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and other banking or banking-related subsidiaries that East West may establish or acquire. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the Company had $69.6 billion in total assets, $51.5 billion in total net loans, $56.1 billion in total deposits, and $7.0 billion in total stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\nThe Company operates in over 120 locations in the U.S. and Asia. In the U.S., the Bank\u2019s corporate headquarters and main administrative offices are located in California; its U.S. branches and offices are located in California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Nevada. In Asia, the Bank has four full-service branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen; five representative offices in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Singapore; and administrative support offices in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe are committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value by growing loans, deposits and revenue, improving profitability, and investing for the future while managing risks, expenses and capital. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers\u2019 financial goals, and meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs through our diverse products and services. Our strategy focuses on seeking out and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return parameters. This guides our decision-making across every aspect of our operations: the products and services we develop, the expertise we cultivate, and the infrastructure we build to help our customers conduct their businesses. We expect our relationship-focused business model to continue to generate organic growth from existing customers and to expand our targeted customer bases. We constantly invest in technology to improve the customer user experience, strengthen critical business infrastructure, and streamline core processes, while properly managing operating expenses. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that the Bank identifies and manages risks to sustain safety and soundness while maximizing profitability.\n\nEast West Bank has a commercial business operating license in China through its subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, which makes it unique among U.S.-based regional banks. This license allows the Bank to open branches, make loans and collect deposits in the country. The Bank continues to develop its international banking presence in Asia with its network of overseas branches and representative offices. In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade financing to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients and develop new business relationships. Through its branches and offices, the Bank focuses on growing its cross-border client base between the U.S. and Asia, helping U.S.-based businesses expand in Asia, and assisting companies based in Asia pursue business opportunities in the U.S.\n\nThe Bank believes its customers benefit from the Bank\u2019s understanding of the Asian market through its physical presence, corporate and organizational ties in Asia, as well as the Bank\u2019s international banking products and services. The Bank believes this approach, combined with its senior management and Board of Directors\u2019 ties to Asian business opportunities and Asian American communities, provides the Bank with a competitive advantage. The Bank utilizes its presence overseas to identify and build corporate relationships, which the Bank may leverage to create business opportunities in California and other U.S. markets.\n\n5\n\n---\n\nBanking Services\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, East West Bank was the largest independent commercial bank headquartered in Southern California based on total assets. The Bank is the largest independent bank in the U.S. focused on the financial service needs of individuals and businesses that operate both in the U.S. and Asia, and has a strong focus on the Asian American community. Through its network of over 120 banking locations in the U.S. and Asia, the Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services to individuals and businesses. The Bank provides services to its customers in English and in over 10 other languages. In addition to offering traditional deposit products that include personal and business checking and savings accounts, money market, and time deposits, the Bank also offers foreign exchange, treasury management and wealth management services. The Bank\u2019s lending activities include commercial and residential real estate lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance, equipment financing and loan syndication. The Bank also provides financing services to clients to facilitate their business transactions between the U.S. and Asia. Additionally, to support the business needs of its customers, the Bank offers hedging advisory and various derivative contracts such as interest rate, energy commodity and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nThe integration of digital with brick-and-mortar channels has been an area of investment for the Bank, for both commercial and consumer banking. Our strategic priorities include the use of technology to innovate and expand commercial payments, treasury management products and services, and consumer banking. We have developed mobile and online banking platforms, which are continually enhanced to enrich our customer user experience, and which offer a full suite of banking services tailored to our customers\u2019 unique needs. In our view, the omnichannel banking service approach increases efficiency and deepens customer relationships.\n\nOperating Segments\n\nThe Bank\u2019s three operating segments, (1) Consumer and Business Banking, (2) Commercial Banking and (3) Other, are based on the Bank\u2019s core strategy. The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company\u2019s domestic branch network and digital banking platforms. The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. The remaining centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, are aggregated and included in the Other segment. For complete discussion and disclosure, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) \u2014 Results of Operation \u2014 Operating Segment Results and Note 17 \u2014 Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company faces intense competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions, numerous other financial services providers and other entities, including as a result of emerging technologies. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, quality and range of products and services offered, reputation, fees, interest rates on loans and deposits and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of customers and locations served. The Company is a leader of banking market share in the Asian American community. The Company maintains a differentiated presence within selected markets by providing cross-border commercial banking expertise to customers between the U.S. and Asia.\n\nWhile the Company believes it is well positioned within a highly competitive industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continuing consolidation.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs a company that delivers relationship-driven financial solutions to a diverse customer base, we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the most significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, develop and retain quality talent who embody our values and enable us to serve our customers. To achieve these objectives, our human resource programs have been designed based on our core values and the attributes we seek to foster, which include absolute integrity; customer orientation; creativity; respect and fairness; teamwork; expertise and professionalism; and selflessness. We use these core values to better service our customers and prepare our employees for leadership positions and to advance their careers. We are also committed to promoting diversity in employment and advancement, and recognizing our employees for their contributions and service to our bank.\n\n6\n\n---\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we had 3,206 full-time equivalent employees, of which 229 were located in China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Nearly all of our workforce were full-time employees, predominantly located in our core markets of California, Texas and New York. The Company\u2019s compensation and employee benefits expense was $509 million and $478 million, or 50% and 56% of total noninterest expense in 2023 and 2022, respectively. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nEast West Bank was founded in 1973 in Chinatown, Los Angeles, California as a savings & loan association for immigrants who were underserved by mainstream banks. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the Bank was the largest FDIC-insured, minority-operated depository institution headquartered in the U.S., serving communities with diverse ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds in eight states across the nation. Our operations are concentrated in areas that include larger numbers of immigrants and minorities. We proudly offer home loans and other products and services that support low-to-moderate income, minority and immigrant communities. We also provide community development loans, and partner with a diverse list of nonprofit and community-based organizations to promote wealth generation and entrepreneurship in underserved communities. Our focus on basic, fair-priced products and alternative credit criteria supports the under-banked, which is part of our founding mission. In addition, given our diverse customer base and the diversity of the communities that we serve, our retail bankers are able to assist customers in English and in over 10 other languages.\n\nPromoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce and executive leadership is critical to our continued growth and success, and is at the core of our guiding principles. Our commitment to this mission is reflected in the composition of our employees. In addition, we have adopted an Environmental and Social Policy Framework that governs our mission to support diversity, and formed an LGBTQ+ & Allies employee resource group in addition to our two existing employee resource groups that focus on cultural awareness and empowering women to pursue leadership development and opportunities. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the composition of our workforce was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | | % of Total Workforce | | |  | | | % of Total Managers | | |\n| Gender (1): | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Female | | |  | | | 62% | | |  | | | 58% | | |\n| Male | | |  | | | 38% | | |  | | | 42% | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Race/ethnicity: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Minorities: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Asian minorities | | |  | | | 74% | | |  | | | 74% | | |\n| Non-Asian minorities | | |  | | | 15% | | |  | | | 12% | | |\n| White | | |  | | | 11% | | |  | | | 14% | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n(1)Presented as a percentage of the respective populations who self-identified.\n\nTo put our diversity in context, minorities made up 46% of the workforce and 18% of the managers of FDIC-regulated institutions, according to the most recently available 2020 Diversity Self-Assessment from the FDIC\u2019s Financial Institution Diversity Self-Assessment program. Our organizational commitment to diversity, under the leadership and oversight of our Board of Directors, is further reflected by the composition of our 11-member Board, which is presented in the following table as of December\u00a031, 2023. This commitment to diversity was acknowledged in Bank Director\u2019s 2022 \u201cRankingBanking\u201d study, in which we received the \u201cBest Board\u201d ranking due to our strong corporate governance practices, and the diversity and expertise of our directors.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | | Female | | |  | | | Male | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Race/ethnicity: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Minorities: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Asian minorities | | |  | | | 2 | | |  | | | 2 | | |\n| Non-Asian minorities | | |  | | | 1 | | |  | | | 2 | | |\n| White | | |  | | | \u2014 | | |  | | | 4 | | |\n| Sexual orientation: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| LGBTQ+ | | |  | | | \u2014 | | |  | | | 1 | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n7\n\n---\n\nTalent Acquisition, Development, Promotion and Engagement\n\nAn experienced and well-qualified workforce is essential to delivering high quality and reliable banking services to our customers and to managing the Company in a safe and sound manner. We endeavor to attract, develop, and retain diverse, motivated talent as part of our ongoing commitment to building a stronger workforce to serve our customers and communities. As a result, we were able to continue our quality hiring efforts with over 500 external new hires in 2023.\n\nThe focus on leadership development and promoting from within is a critical part of our succession planning for key roles throughout the organization and fostering organizational stability. We recognize the importance of employee development and career growth in fostering retention of our employees, which is one of the Company's strategic objectives. In 2023, 18% of our employees advanced their careers within the Bank through over 550 internal promotions or new opportunities. We provide a variety of resources to help all employees grow in their current roles and build new skills for future advancement, including the encouragement of continuing education and providing benefits such as tuition reimbursement.\n\nWe celebrate our employees\u2019 dedicated years of service to the Bank through our Milestone Anniversary Program, which offers rewards and recognition through gifts and events when our employees reach certain service milestones. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 300 of our employees have celebrated 20 years or more of service. In 2023, we commemorated our 50th anniversary. With our employees\u2019 commitment, strength, expertise and contribution, we earned the \u201cNo. 1 Performing Bank\u201d ranking in the $50 billion and above asset category in Bank Director\u2019s 2023 RankingBanking study. We were also ranked among the top 5 in Fortune\u2019s Best Workplaces for Women in 2023 and were named one of Newsweek\u2019s 100 Most Loved Workplaces in 2022 and 2023. We were also recognized as one of five banks featured in ARTnews\u2019 75 Top Art World Professionals in 2023.\n\nFair and Equitable Compensation\n\nOur compensation and benefits program provides both short- and long-term awards, incentivizing performance, and aligning employee and stockholder interests. Employee compensation packages include a competitive base salary and, subject to Company and individual performance, may include an annual cash and stock incentive bonus. We are committed to fair and equitable compensation programs, and regularly assess the current business environment and labor markets to review our compensation and benefits program for pay equity. We sponsor a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, provide a Company matching contribution, and maintain other defined contribution retirement plans. As of December\u00a031, 2023, 98% of employees participated in our 401(k) plan.\n\nTo foster a strong sense of ownership and to align the interests of our employees with our stockholders, restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees under our stock incentive programs. We also award stock grants under our \u201cSpirit of Ownership\u201d program to all of our employees, regardless of job title or part-time/full-time status. The program allows each employee to share directly in the success they help create. The fact that all our employees are also owners is a source of pride for us. In 2023, the Company granted over 600 thousand restricted stock units as part of its stock compensation programs.\n\nHealth and Well-being\n\nWe are committed to supporting our employees\u2019 well-being by offering flexible and competitive benefits. We offer a hybrid schedule to promote flexibility and enhance productivity among our associates. Comprehensive health insurance coverage (medical, dental and vision) is offered to employees working at least 30 hours each week. We offer life insurance, disability insurance, parental leave, wellness and benefits programs designed to assist employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, paid time off such as vacation hours, and 10 days of annual sick time, which is more than the required allotment from any of the states in which we do business. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program, which aids benefits-eligible employees and their household members with personal and professional issues. We apply a consistent approach towards employee policies, opportunities, benefits, and protections to all employees regardless of their locations, except if there are contradictions between individual state laws.\n\nCommitment to Community\n\nWe are committed to making positive and lasting impacts in our communities through our business activities and our volunteer and charitable efforts. We aim to enhance the quality of life in our communities by engaging in meaningful and effective programs that help increase homeownership, preserve affordable housing, promote wealth building, enable more inclusive access to banking services and help alleviate homelessness.

Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) administered by the FDIC, consumers, and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our investors. As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and, with respect to consumer laws, the CFPB. As the insurer of the Bank\u2019s deposits, the FDIC has back-up examination authority of the Bank as well. In addition, the Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, are regulated by foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we have a presence, including China, Hong Kong and Singapore. East West also has a wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary, East West Markets, LLC (\"East West Markets\"), which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\"FINRA\"). East West Markets is subject to regulatory requirements from several regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol \u201cEWBC\u201d and subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies.\n\nDescribed below are certain provisions of selected statutes and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete, nor are they meant to fully address the statutes and regulations\u2019 effects and potential effects on East West and the Bank, and the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\n9\n\n---\n\nEast West\n\nAs a bank holding company and pursuant to its election of financial holding company status, East West is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The BHC Act provides a federal framework for the regulation and supervision of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The BHC Act and other federal statutes grant the Federal Reserve authority to, among other things:\n\n\u2022require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion;\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (see the section captioned \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d included elsewhere under this item);\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank, including at times when bank holding companies may not be inclined to do so, and the failure to do so generally may be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and a violation of Federal Reserve regulations;\n\n\u2022restrict dividends and other distributions from subsidiary banks to their parent bank holding companies;\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain nonbank subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity, ownership, or control of the nonbank subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company, or if the activity, ownership, or control is inconsistent with the purposes of the BHC Act;\n\n\u2022regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements and requiring a bank holding company to obtain prior approval to purchase or redeem its securities in certain situations;\n\n\u2022approve in advance senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit certain golden parachute payments to officers and employees, including change in control agreements and new employment agreements, that are contingent upon termination; and\n\n\u2022approve in advance the acquisitions of and mergers with bank holding companies, banks and other financial companies, and consider competitive, managerial resources, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. DFPI approval may also be required for certain acquisitions and mergers involving a California state-chartered bank such as the Bank.\n\nEast West has elected to be a financial holding company as permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (\u201cGLBA\u201d). Financial holding companies are generally allowed to engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any such activity, without prior Federal Reserve approval. Activities that are considered financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, merchant banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. To maintain financial holding company status and continue to be able to engage in new activities or investments that are financial in nature, a financial holding company and all its depository institution subsidiaries must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed,\u201d and the financial holding company\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries must have Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) ratings of at least \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d A depository institution subsidiary is considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d and \u201cPrompt Corrective Action,\u201d included elsewhere under this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered \u201cwell managed\u201d if it received a composite rating and a management rating of at least \u201cSatisfactory\u201d in its most recent examination. See the section captioned \u201cCommunity Reinvestment Act\u201d included elsewhere under this item.\n\n10\n\n---\n\nThe Bank and its Subsidiaries\n\nEast West Bank is a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank\u2019s operations in the U.S. are primarily regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, and its activities outside the U.S. are regulated and supervised by its U.S. regulators and the applicable regulatory authority in the host country in which each overseas office is located. Specific federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks monitor, among other things, their regulatory capital levels, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. Bank regulatory agencies also have extensive discretion to impose various restrictions on management or operations and to issue policies and guidance in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state-chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. The Bank may also form subsidiaries to engage in many activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries. Further, pursuant to the GLBA, the Bank may conduct certain \u201cfinancial\u201d activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d and has a CRA rating of at least \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d\n\nRegulation of Foreign Subsidiaries and Branches\n\nThe Bank\u2019s foreign subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the PBOC and the NAFR. East West Bank\u2019s Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the HKMA and the HKSFC. The Bank\u2019s Singapore representative office is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the MAS.\n\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe federal banking agencies have imposed capital adequacy requirements, known as the Basel III Capital Rules, intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital, including Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d), Tier 1 and 2 capital, and set forth minimum capital adequacy ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets and total assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weighting assets and include a number of risk-weighting categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, to be considered adequately capitalized, standardized approach banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of at least 4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0% total risk-based capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets and a 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Banking institutions with a risk-based capital ratio that meets or exceeds the minimum requirement but does not exceed the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy requirements of the federal banking agencies, including the capital conservation buffer, and the Company and the Bank were classified as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For additional discussion and disclosure see Item 7. MD&A \u2014 Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 \u2014 Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nThe Bank is also subject to additional capital requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d) regulations that implement Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\u201cFDIA\u201d), as discussed below under the Prompt Corrective Action section.\n\nRegulatory Capital-Related Developments\n\nFrom time to time, the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. Such proposals and interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our regulatory capital requirements and reported capital ratios.\n\n11\n\n---\n\nPursuant to the five-year transition rule approved by the U.S. federal banking agencies in March 2020, the effects of the current expected credit loss accounting standard (\u201cCECL\u201d) on the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital were delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects are being phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For additional discussion and disclosure on CECL, see Item 7. MD&A \u2014 Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 \u2014 Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies jointly released a proposed rule to implement the international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and known as \u201cBasel III Endgame.\u201d The Basel III Endgame proposal would revise the capital framework applicable to large banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets or with significant trading activity and, if finalized, would likely result in meaningfully increased capital requirements for those organizations. The Company has total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion and does not have significant trading activity, and therefore would not be subject to the Basel III Endgame requirements if they are finalized as proposed. However, by imposing additional costs on banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, this rule proposal could reduce the benefits of growth beyond that size for a banking organization that has less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe FDIA, as amended, requires federal banking agencies to take PCA with respect to insured depository institutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d A depository institution\u2019s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulations. The capital tiers in the PCA framework do not apply directly to bank holding companies (such as the Company). Under the federal banking agencies\u2019 regulations implementing the PCA provisions of the FDIA, an IDI (such as the Bank) generally is classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | Risk-Based Capital Ratios | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |\n| PCA Category | | |  | | | Total Capital | | |  | | | Tier 1 Capital | | |  | | | CET1 Capital | | |  | | | Tier 1 Leverage | | |\n| Well capitalized (1) | | |  | | | \u2265 10% | | |  | | | \u2265 8% | | |  | | | \u2265 6.5% | | |  | | | \u2265 5% | | |\n| Adequately capitalized | | |  | | | \u2265 8% | | |  | | | \u2265 6% | | |  | | | \u2265 4.5% | | |  | | | \u2265 4% | | |\n| Undercapitalized | | |  | | | < 8% | | |  | | | < 6% | | |  | | | < 4.5% | | |  | | | < 4% | | |\n| Significantly undercapitalized | | |  | | | < 6% | | |  | | | < 4% | | |  | | | < 3.0% | | |  | | | < 3% | | |\n| Critically undercapitalized | | |  | | | Tangible equity/Total assets \u2264 2% | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n(1)Additionally, to be classified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, an IDI may not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or PCA directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\n\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank\u2019s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank\u2019s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\n\nThe FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of any dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to several requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and/or restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits. \u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIA also generally permits only \u201cwell capitalized\u201d IDIs to accept brokered deposits, although an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution may apply to the FDIC for a waiver of this restriction.\n\n12\n\n---\n\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and Stress Testing\n\nIn May 2018, the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) amended certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes administered by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies. The EGRRCPA lifted the asset size threshold for many of the Dodd-Frank Act enhanced prudential standards that had previously applied to banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $100 billion, except for the requirement to maintain a risk committee. The EGRRCPA also raised the asset size threshold for required company-run stress testing at banks and bank holding companies from $10 billion to $250 billion. Additionally, based on authority provided in the EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve raised the asset size threshold for required supervisory stress testing at bank holding companies from $50 billion to $100 billion. Although the Company and the Bank are not required to conduct company-run or supervisory stress tests, we continue to conduct annual capital and quarterly liquidity stress tests.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the authority to implement, examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions with total consolidated assets exceeding $10 billion (such as the Bank) and their affiliates. The CFPB focuses its supervisory, examination, and enforcement efforts on, among other things:\n\n\u2022risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when evaluating the policies and practices of a financial institution;\n\n\u2022unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices;\n\n\u2022rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act; and\n\n\u2022the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets.\n\nThe statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting payments on loans, and providing other services. The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has affected and will continue to impact financial institutions that provide consumer financial products and services, including the Company and the Bank. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer.\u00a0Failure to comply with federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, abusive, or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition, can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages, restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights or business opportunities and may also result in significant reputational harm.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Reserve Requirements\n\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of San Francisco. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access the FHLB for both short- and long-term secured credit.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. The Bank is a member bank and stockholder of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\u201cFRBSF\u201d).\n\n13\n\n---\n\nDividends and Other Transfers of Funds\n\nThe principal source of liquidity of East West is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies may prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank\u2019s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal PCA regime, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company\u2019s bank subsidiary is classified as \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or, in some circumstances, \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d It is the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the company\u2019s net income available to common stockholders over the past four quarters, net of distributions, would be sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy that a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company\u2019s ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations\u2019 financial condition and in compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are strong.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\n\nPursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their parent bank holding companies. Regulation W limits the types, terms and amounts of these transactions and generally requires the transactions to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis. In general, Regulation W requires that \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d which include a bank\u2019s extension of credit to or purchase of assets from an affiliate, be limited to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital and surplus with respect to any one affiliate, and 20% of the bank\u2019s capital and surplus with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates. In addition, a bank generally may not extend credit to an affiliate unless the extension of credit is secured by specified amounts of collateral. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions, including by treating derivative transactions resulting in a bank\u2019s credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as \u201cSuper 23A\u201d and \u201cSuper 23B\u201d) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund.\n\nFederal law also limits a bank\u2019s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons (collectively, \u201cinsiders\u201d). Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank\u2019s capital.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nUnder the CRA, an IDI has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates a state member bank\u2019s performance under applicable performance criteria and assign a rating of \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial noncompliance.\u201d The Federal Reserve takes this performance into account when reviewing applications by banks and their parent companies to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or acquire other financial institutions. Unsatisfactory CRA performance may result in the denial of such applications. Based on the most recent CRA examination as of March 8, 2021, the Bank was rated \u201coutstanding\u201d.\n\n14\n\n---\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule revising their framework for evaluating banks\u2019 records of community reinvestment under the CRA. Under the revised framework, banks with assets of at least $2 billion, such as the Bank, are considered large banks and their retail lending, retail services and products, community development financing, and community development services will be subject to periodic evaluation. Depending on a large bank\u2019s geographic distribution of lending, the evaluation of retail lending may include assessment areas in which the bank extends loans but does not operate any deposit-taking facilities, in addition to assessment areas in which the bank has deposit taking facilities. The rule becomes effective April 1, 2024. Compliance with most provisions of the final rule will be required beginning January 1, 2026, and compliance with the remaining provisions will be required beginning January 1, 2027. The Company is evaluating the impact of the final rule.\n\nFDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe FDIC insures the Bank\u2019s customer deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly insurance assessments on insured banks based on their assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC\u2019s fund management authority by establishing a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio of 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The Bank\u2019s DIF quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate. The assessment rate is calculated based on an institution\u2019s risk profile, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank\u2019s failure.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all IDIs, to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) to increase the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The increase in rates took effect in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special deposit insurance assessment to recover losses to the DIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the receiverships of failed institutions in the spring of 2023. Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an IDI\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits, reported for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, minus the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods starting with the first quarter of 2024, at a quarterly rate of 3.36 bps. The Company recognized the entire assessment expense of approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Depending on future adjustments to the DIF\u2019s estimated loss, the FDIC has retained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period, or impose a one-time final shortfall assessment.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution\u2019s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or that the institution has violated any applicable rule, regulation, condition, or order imposed by the FDIC.\n\nBank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d), Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001 (\u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d), the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 and other federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions to implement and maintain a program reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report money laundering and the financing of terrorism, verify the identity of their customers, and comply with recordkeeping and other requirements. Regulatory agencies require that the Bank have an effective governance structure for the program that includes effective oversight by our Board of Directors and management. We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our program to comply with the BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) laws, regulations and initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML programs, or to comply with all applicable laws or regulations, could have serious legal, compliance, operational, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.\n\n15\n\n---\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. financial institutions do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various executive orders and Acts of Congress. Federal banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with regulations administered by the OFAC for economic sanctions against designated foreign countries, designated nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction or account relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, compliance, operational, financial, and reputational consequences, and result in civil monetary penalties on the Company and the Bank.\n\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\n\nFederal statutes and regulations, including the GLBA, require banking organizations to take certain actions to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has a privacy policy that it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer\u2019s consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank\u2019s sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. These additional conditions affect the Bank\u2019s information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank\u2019s privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are subjects covered in the Federal Reserve\u2019s periodic compliance examinations.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and state regulators, as well as the SEC, CFPB and other self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance on cybersecurity practices and procedures that is intended to enhance cybersecurity risk management among financial institutions and their holding companies and affiliates. For example, the interagency council of the federal banking agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d), has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks in light of the growing risk posed by cybersecurity threats. The FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials, cyber resilience and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution\u2019s information technology and its ability to thwart or mitigate cyber-attacks. The federal banking agencies require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred. Effective December 2023, the SEC also has imposed Form 8-K disclosure obligations for a material cybersecurity incident, among other cybersecurity related disclosure obligations.\n\nConsumer data privacy and data protection are also the subject of state laws. For example, the Bank is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). This statute grants consumers several rights, including the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request correction of information, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. However, a consumer does not have these rights with respect to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA or the California Financial Information Privacy Act. The CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act. A new agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency, was established to enforce California privacy law.\n\nThe privacy and data protection regime in China is in a period of change and there has been significant activity in the field of privacy and cybersecurity legislation in recent years. The Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d), the Cybersecurity Law and the Data Security Law form a regulatory framework for privacy and data protection in China. The PIPL establishes guiding principles on the protection of a Chinese citizen\u2019s personal information and applies to entities operating in China, foreign organizations, and individuals processing personal information outside China. The Cybersecurity Law focuses on cybersecurity concerns and requires network operators to implement measures to safeguard the security of networks and systems. The Data Security Law complements the PIPL and Cybersecurity Law by addressing broader data security issues, emphasizing the protection of critical data infrastructure and promoting a risk-based approach to data security. New supporting guidelines and standards are expected as China's cybersecurity, data security, and personal information protection framework continues to evolve. All these changes have potential impact on the business and operations of our Bank and its subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited.\n\n16\n\n---\n\nClimate-Related Risk Management\n\nIn recent years, the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climate-related risks affecting the operations of banks, the communities they serve and the broader financial system. The agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding banks\u2019 climate risk management practices, including by proposing guidance that would encourage banking organizations to, among other things: evaluate the potential impact of climate-related risks on the bank\u2019s financial condition, operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process; account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments; revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors; and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a low-carbon economy and related changes in laws, regulations, governmental policies, technology, and consumer behavior and expectations.\n\nIn October 2023, the federal banking agencies released interagency guidance, \u201cPrinciples for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions\u201d (the \u201cPrinciples\u201d), which are intended to encourage banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets to focus on key aspects of climate-related financial risk management. The Principles cover six areas: governance; policies, procedures, and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement, and reporting; and scenario analysis. The Principles also describe how large banking organizations should manage climate-related financial risks that can arise in risk categories such as credit, liquidity, and other financial risk, and operational, legal and compliance, and other nonfinancial risk. While the agencies\u2019 efforts to-date, including the Principles, have focused on banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, their supervisory expectations on climate risk management practices ultimately may apply to smaller banking organizations such as the Bank.\n\nIn addition, states such as California, are taking similar actions on climate-related financial risks. In October 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Senate Bill 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (\u201cCCDAA\u201d) and Senate Bill 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (\u201cCRFRA\u201d). The CCDAA is applicable to U.S.-organized entities that do business in California with annual revenue in excess of $1 billion. Subject to the adoption of implementing regulations by the California Air Resources Board, these entities will need to file annual reports publicly disclosing their direct greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions from operations (\u201cScope 1 emissions\u201d), indirect GHG emissions from energy use (\u201cScope 2 emissions\u201d) and indirect upstream and downstream supply-chain GHG emissions (\u201cScope 3 emissions\u201d). The reporting requirements related to Scope 1 and 2 emissions will begin in 2026, while the reporting requirements of Scope 3 emissions will begin in 2027. The CRFRA requires U.S.-organized entities that do business in California, with annual revenues over $500 million to prepare biennial reports disclosing climate-related financial risk and the measures they have adopted to reduce and adapt to that risk. The initial round of the climate risk disclosure reports will be due by January 1, 2026. The Company is a reporting entity under both laws and may incur compliance, maintenance and remediation costs to conform to such requirements.\n\nPotential Regulatory Reforms\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the FDIC released a proposed rule that would require covered IDIs to develop and submit detailed plans demonstrating how they could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership. IDIs with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit full resolution plans, and IDIs with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion, including the Bank, would be required to submit more limited informational filings. Under the proposal, if the FDIC deemed a resolution plan or informational filing not credible and the IDI failed to resubmit a credible plan, the IDI could become subject to an enforcement action. The Company is evaluating the impact of this proposal.\n\nThe federal banking agencies also jointly released a proposed rule on August 29, 2023 that would require bank holding companies and non-consolidated banks with total assets of $100 billion or more to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt. The Company has total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion and would not be subject to the long-term debt requirements if they are finalized as proposed. However, by imposing additional costs on bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, this rule proposal could reduce the benefits of growth beyond that size for a bank holding company that has less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company.\n\n17\n\n---\n\nFuture Legislation, Regulation and Supervision Activities\n\nNew statutes, regulations and policies that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions and public companies operating in the U.S. are regularly adopted. Such changes to applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may change the Company\u2019s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase the Company\u2019s cost of conducting business, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, subject the Company to increased supervision activities and disclosure and reporting requirements, and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage.
