Risk Factors and the section captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results\u201d in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report.\n\nThe Corporation\n\nCullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a Texas business corporation incorporated in 1977, is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in San Antonio, Texas that provides, through its subsidiaries, a broad array of products and services throughout numerous Texas markets. The terms \u201cCullen/Frost,\u201d \u201cthe Corporation,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d mean Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, when appropriate. We offer commercial and consumer banking services, as well as trust and investment management, insurance, brokerage, mutual funds, leasing, treasury management, capital markets advisory and item processing services. At December\u00a031, 2024, Cullen/Frost had consolidated total assets of $52.5 billion and was one of the largest independent bank holding companies headquartered in the State of Texas.\n\nOur philosophy is to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe, sound assets. We operate as a locally-oriented, community-based financial services organization, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select critical areas. Our local market orientation is reflected in our regional management and regional advisory boards, which are comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives that assist our regional management in responding to local banking needs. Despite this local market, community-based focus, we offer many of the products available at much larger money-center financial institutions.\n\nWe serve a wide variety of industries including, among others, energy, manufacturing, services, construction, retail, telecommunications, healthcare, military and transportation. Our customer base is similarly diverse. We are not dependent upon any single industry or customer.\n\nOur operating objectives include expansion, diversification within our markets, growth of our fee-based income, and growth internally and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches and financial services businesses. While we are currently focused on organic growth, we may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. From time to time, we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions, whether or not any regulatory approval is required, will be dependent upon our bank regulators\u2019 views at the time as to the capital levels, quality of management and our overall condition and their assessment of a variety of other factors. Certain merger or acquisition transactions, including those involving the acquisition of a depository institution or the assumption of the deposits of any depository institution, require formal approval from various bank regulatory authorities, which will be subject to a variety of factors and considerations.\n\nAlthough Cullen/Frost is a corporate entity, legally separate and distinct from its affiliates, bank holding companies such as Cullen/Frost are required to act as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks. The principal source of Cullen/Frost\u2019s income is dividends from its subsidiaries. There are certain regulatory restrictions on the extent to which these subsidiaries can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Cullen/Frost. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d elsewhere in this item for further discussion of these matters.\n\nCullen/Frost\u2019s executive offices are located at 111 W. Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205, and its telephone number is (210)\u00a0220-4011.\n\n4\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nSubsidiaries of Cullen/Frost\n\nFrost Bank\n\nFrost Bank, the principal operating subsidiary and sole banking subsidiary of Cullen/Frost, is a Texas-chartered bank primarily engaged in the business of commercial and consumer banking through approximately 194\u00a0financial centers across Texas in the Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Gulf Coast, Houston, Permian Basin, and San Antonio regions.

Cullen/Frost guarantees, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities. Trust\u00a0II is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. As such, the accounts of Trust\u00a0II are not included in our consolidated financial statements. See our accounting policy related to consolidation in Note\u00a01\u00a0-\u00a0Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item\u00a08.

In addition, we also compete with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, private equity and debt funds, insurance companies, insurance agencies, commercial finance and leasing companies, full service brokerage firms, discount brokerage firms, and financial/wealth technology (\u201cfintech/wealthtech\u201d) firms. Some of our competitors have greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may offer other services that are not provided by us. We generally compete on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, available loan and deposit products, the rates of interest charged on loans, the rates of interest paid for funds, and the availability and pricing of trust, brokerage and insurance services. For further discussion, see the section captioned \u201cWe Operate In A Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area\u201d in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n6\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nSupervision and Regulation\n\nCullen/Frost, Frost Bank and most of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors.\n\nSignificant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries are described below. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations.\n\nRegulatory Agencies\n\nCullen/Frost is a legal entity separate and distinct from Frost Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a financial holding company and a bank holding company, Cullen/Frost is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d), and it and its subsidiaries are subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The BHC Act provides generally for \u201cumbrella\u201d regulation of financial holding companies such as Cullen/Frost by the Federal Reserve Board, and for functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. Cullen/Frost is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Cullen/Frost\u2019s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the trading symbol \u201cCFR\u201d and our Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 4.450% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cCFR PrB.\u201d Accordingly, Cullen/Frost is also subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies.\n\nFrost Bank is a Texas state chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the Texas Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board are the primary regulators of Frost Bank. Deposits at Frost Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to applicable limits.\n\nAll member banks of the Federal Reserve System, including Frost Bank, are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve System's Reserve Banks in an amount equal to six percent of their capital stock and surplus (half paid to acquire the stock with the remainder held as a cash reserve). Member banks do not have any control over the Federal Reserve System as a result of owning the stock and the stock cannot be sold or traded. The annual dividend rate for larger member banks, including Frost Bank, is tied to 10-year U.S. Treasuries with the maximum dividend rate capped at six percent. The total amount of stock dividends that Frost Bank received from the Federal Reserve totaled $1.5 million in 2024, $1.4 million in 2023 and $1.2 million in 2022.\n\nMost of our non-bank subsidiaries also are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state agencies. Frost Brokerage Services, Inc. is regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and state securities regulators. Frost Investment Advisors, LLC and Frost Investment Services, LLC are subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as administered by the SEC. Our insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. Other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to both federal and state laws and regulations. Frost Bank and its affiliates are also subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations.\n\nBank Holding Company Activities\n\nIn general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i)\u00a0financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii)\u00a0complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nfinancial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments, among others.\n\nTo maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed.\u201d A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned \u201cPrompt Corrective Action,\u201d elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered \u201cwell managed\u201d if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent examination. A financial holding company\u2019s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the BHC Act, and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into a confidential agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve Board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of the holding company\u2019s depository institutions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.\n\nIn order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act \u201cCRA\u201d performance evaluation. See the section captioned \u201cCommunity Reinvestment Act\u201d elsewhere in this item.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.\n\nThe BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the Texas Finance Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their parent holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase substantially all of the assets or assume any deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the applicant's managerial and financial resources, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system (e.g., systemic risk), the applicant\u2019s performance record under the CRA (see the section captioned \u201cCommunity Reinvestment Act\u201d elsewhere in this item) and its compliance with law, including fair lending, fair housing and other consumer protection laws, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.\n\nDividends and Stock Repurchases\n\nThe principal source of Cullen/Frost\u2019s liquidity is dividends from Frost Bank. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank\u2019s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank\u2019s undivided profits. Frost Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid. Under the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its \u201cwell capitalized\u201d status, Frost Bank could pay aggregate dividends of approximately $1.2 billion to Cullen/Frost, without obtaining affirmative governmental approvals, at December\u00a031, 2024. This amount is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in future periods.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nIn addition, Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. Additionally, it is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization\u2019s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company\u2019s capital structure.\n\nIn certain circumstances, Cullen/Frost\u2019s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d) was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December\u00a031, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates\n\nTransactions between Frost Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Cullen/Frost or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under federal banking law. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by Frost Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates, and generally requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to Frost Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, any such transaction by Frost Bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and, for credit transactions with any affiliate, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.\n\nFederal law also limits a bank\u2019s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate.\n\nSource of Strength Doctrine\n\nFederal Reserve Board policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, Cullen/Frost is expected to commit resources to support Frost Bank, including at times when Cullen/Frost may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\n\n9\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nCapital Requirements\n\nCullen/Frost and Frost Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cBasel\u00a0III Capital Rules\u201d). The Basel\u00a0III Capital Rules require Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank to maintain the following:\n\n\u2022A minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d that is composed entirely of CET1 capital (resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%);\n\n\u2022A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%);\n\n\u2022A minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and\n\n\u2022A minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the \u201cleverage ratio\u201d).\n\nBanking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account, as detailed above, will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income\u201d (that is, the greater of (i)\u00a0net income for the preceding four quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and (ii)\u00a0average net income over the preceding four quarters).\n\nThe Basel\u00a0III Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 25% of CET1.\n\nIn addition, under the general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel\u00a0III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank, were able to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Both Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their available-for-sale securities portfolio. Under the Basel\u00a0III Capital Rules, trust preferred securities no longer included in our Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out.\n\nIn February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the \u201c2019 CECL Rule\u201d) that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under U.S. GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of adopting a new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provided banking organizations that were required under U.S. GAAP (as of January 2020) to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology\u2019s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). We elected to adopt the five-year transition option. Accordingly, CECL transitional amounts have been added back to CET1 totaling $15.4 million and $30.8 million at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Basel\u00a0III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures (and higher percentages for certain other types of interests), and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\n\n10\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nIn December\u00a02017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. Among other things, these standards revised the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain \u201cunconditionally cancellable commitments,\u201d such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provided a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations, and therefore not to Cullen/Frost or Frost Bank.\n\nIn July\u00a02023, the federal banking regulators proposed revisions to the Basel III Capital Rules to implement the Basel Committee\u2019s 2017 standards and make other changes to the Basel III Capital Rules. The proposal introduced revised credit risk, equity risk, operational risk, credit valuation adjustment risk and market risk requirements, among other changes, which would substantially increase the levels of required capital. Nonetheless, these revised capital requirements would not apply to Cullen/Frost or Frost Bank because they each have less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets and trading assets and liabilities below the threshold for market risk requirements. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to work with the other federal banking regulators in 2025 on a revised proposal.\n\nLiquidity Requirements\n\nThe Basel\u00a0III liquidity framework and regulations of the Federal Reserve require that certain banks and bank holding companies measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity\u2019s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. Rules applicable to certain large banking organizations have been implemented for LCR and for NSFR; however, based on our asset size, these rules do not currently apply to Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the \u201cFDIA\u201d) requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\n\nA bank will be (i)\u00a0\u201cwell capitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii)\u00a0\u201cadequately capitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not \u201cwell capitalized\u201d; (iii)\u00a0\u201cundercapitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv)\u00a0\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v)\u00a0\u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d if the institution\u2019s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank\u2019s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank\u2019s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\n\nThe FDIA prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank\u2019s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is (i) well capitalized, or (ii) adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC.\n\n11\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nAdditionally, the FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d \u201cUndercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution\u2019s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution\u2019s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i)\u00a0an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution\u2019s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii)\u00a0the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cSignificantly undercapitalized\u201d depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. \u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.\n\nThe appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution.\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, Frost Bank, was \u201cwell capitalized\u201d based on the aforementioned ratios. For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank see the discussion under the section captioned \u201cCapital and Liquidity\u201d included in Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note\u00a08 -\u00a0Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, elsewhere in this report.\n\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to bank holding companies. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the bank holding company level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the bank holding company\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries.\n\nSafety and Soundness Standards\n\nThe FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d provisions of the\n\n12\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nFDIA. See \u201cPrompt Corrective Action\u201d above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties and cease and desist orders.\n\nDeposit Insurance\n\nDeposits at Frost Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC and Frost Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity. For larger institutions, such as Frost Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank\u2019s capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations.\n\nUnder the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule that increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2\u00a0basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment was expected to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline prescribed under the FDIC\u2019s amended restoration plan.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover losses to the DIF incurred as a result of bank failures earlier that year and the FDIC\u2019s use of the systemic risk exception to cover certain deposits that were otherwise uninsured. The special assessment was based on estimated uninsured deposits as of December\u00a031, 2022 (excluding the first $5.0\u00a0billion) and was assessed at a quarterly rate of 3.36\u00a0basis points, over eight quarterly assessment periods, that began in the first quarter of 2024. In June 2024, due to the increased estimate of losses, the FDIC announced that it projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at a lower rate. This updated assessment was made under the FDIC\u2019s final rule whereby the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination can be periodically adjusted. The FDIC has also retained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment. The special assessments are tax deductible. The extent to which any such additional future assessments will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board is required to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies and certain non-bank covered companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) mandates that certain regulatory requirements applicable to these systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions. The enhanced prudential standards rules, as amended in 2019, require a bank holding company to establish a risk committee that approves and periodically reviews its risk-management policies and oversees its risk-management framework beginning on the first day of the ninth quarter following the date on which the bank holding company\u2019s average total consolidated assets equal or exceed $50\u00a0billion. Cullen/Frost\u2019s total consolidated assets surpassed $50\u00a0billion this year but it already maintains a risk committee that performs these functions.\n\nResolution Planning\n\nThe FDIC requires certain insured depository institutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d) with more than $50\u00a0billion in total consolidated assets to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution\u2019s failure. In June\u00a02024, the FDIC finalized amendments to the resolution planning requirements for IDIs with $50 billion or more in total assets. The amendments require IDIs with between $50 billion and $100 billion in assets, which includes Frost Bank, to submit informational filings on a three-year cycle, with an interim supplement updating key information submitted in the off years. The final rule became effective October\u00a01, 2024.\n\n13\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nThe Volcker Rule\n\nThe so-called Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule does not significantly impact the operations of Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule.\n\nDepositor Preference\n\nThe FDIA provides that, in the event of the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.\n\nInterchange Fees\n\nUnder the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions.\n\nInterchange fees, or \u201cswipe\u201d fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10\u00a0billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21\u00a0cents per transaction and 5\u00a0basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer\u2019s debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. In October 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal under which the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction would be the sum of 14.4\u00a0cents per transaction and 4\u00a0basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Furthermore, the fraud-prevention adjustment would increase from a maximum of 1\u00a0cent to 1.3\u00a0cents per debit card transaction. The proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap, which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered by the Federal Reserve from large debit card issuers. The comment period for this proposal ended in May 2024. The extent to which any such proposed changes in permissible interchange fees will impact our future revenues is currently uncertain.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection\n\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\n14\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) is a federal agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, laws relating to fair lending and the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer\u2019s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer\u2019s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii)\u00a0inability to self-protect in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii)\u00a0reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer\u2019s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10\u00a0billion in assets, as well as their affiliates. Banking regulators take into account compliance with consumer protection laws when considering approval of a proposed transaction.\n\nIn October\u00a02024, the CFPB issued a final rule that requires a provider of payment accounts or products, such as a bank, to make data available to consumers, free upon request, regarding the products or services they obtain from the provider. Any such data provider is also required to make such data available to third parties, with the consumer\u2019s express authorization and through an interface that satisfies formatting, performance, and security standards, for the purpose of such third parties providing the consumer with financial products or services requested by the consumer. Data required to be made available under the rule includes transaction information, account balance, account and routing numbers, terms and conditions, upcoming bill information, and certain account verification data. The final rule is intended to give consumers control over their financial data, including with whom it is shared, and encourage competition in the provision of consumer financial products or services. Banks with over $10\u00a0billion and less than $250\u00a0billion in total assets, including Frost Bank, must comply with the new requirements by April\u00a01, 2027.\n\nIn December\u00a02024, the CFPB issued a final rule that, among other things, amends Regulation\u00a0Z (otherwise known as the \u201cTruth In Lending Act\u201d) and impacts extensions of overdraft credit offered by financial institutions with more than $10\u00a0billion in assets. The final rule defines overdraft credit as generally including consumer credit extended by a financial institution to pay a transaction from a checking or other transaction account (other than a prepaid account) held at the financial institution when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in that account. The final rule requires that extensions of overdraft credit adhere to consumer protections required of similarly situated products, unless the overdraft fee is at or below the institution's costs and losses as determined by (i)\u00a0calculating its own costs and losses using a standard set forth in the rule; or (ii)\u00a0relying on a benchmark flat fee of five dollars. An overdraft that incurs charges that exceed costs and losses will become a covered overdraft credit and subject to Regulation Z which requires that lenders disclose borrowing costs, interest rates and fees upfront and in clear language so consumers can understand all the terms and make informed decisions. Furthermore, covered overdraft credit extensions must be put in a credit account and may not be structured as a negative balance on a checking or other transaction account. The provisions of the final rule become effective on October\u00a01, 2025.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nThe CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction. Frost Bank received a rating of \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent CRA performance evaluations.\n\nIn October\u00a02023, the OCC, together with the Federal Reserve and FDIC, issued a joint final rule to modernize the CRA regulatory framework. The final rule is intended, among other things, to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including the expanded role of mobile and online banking, and to tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size and business models. The final rule introduces new tests under which the performance of banks with over $2 billion in assets will be assessed. The new rule also includes data collection and reporting\n\n15\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nrequirements, some of which are applicable only to banks with over $10\u00a0billion in assets, such as Frost Bank. Most provisions of the final rule will become effective on January\u00a01, 2026, and the data reporting requirements will become effective on January\u00a01, 2027. The final rule is currently enjoined as to the plaintiff trade associations while a federal court considers a lawsuit challenging the rule.\n\nFinancial Privacy\n\nThe federal banking regulators have adopted rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act\n\nA major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d) and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d) require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent them from being used for, and to detect and deter, money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.\n\nIn August 2024, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), which drafts regulations implementing the U.S. Patriot Act, BSA and other anti-money laundering legislation, adopted a rule extending anti-money laundering obligations, including maintenance of an anti-money laundering program and filing certain reports with FinCEN, to registered investment advisers, like certain of Cullen/Frost\u2019s subsidiaries. Compliance with these requirements is required beginning on January 1, 2026.\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. These sanctions include: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on \u201cU.S. persons\u201d engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country, and (ii) blocking assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including the imposition of civil money penalties or causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\n16\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nIncentive Compensation\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Cullen/Frost, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\nUnder regulatory guidance applicable to all banking organizations, incentive compensation policies must be consistent with safety and soundness principles. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i)\u00a0provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii)\u00a0be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii)\u00a0be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank), but these proposed rules have not been finalized.\n\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or \u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The NYSE\u2019s listing standards pursuant to the SEC\u2019s rule became effective on October\u00a02, 2023. We adopted a compensation recovery policy pursuant to the NYSE listing standards on October\u00a025, 2023. The policy is included as Exhibit\u00a097.1 to this Form 10-K.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If we fail to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. In 2023, the SEC issued a final rule that requires disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Under this rule, banking organizations that are SEC registrants must generally disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of determining it is material with periodic updates as to the status of the incident in subsequent filings, as necessary.\n\nBanking organizations are required to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States.\n\nState regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states, including Texas, have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located.\n\n17\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nRisks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.\n\nIn May\u00a02024, the SEC finalized amendments to Regulation S-P to require broker-dealers, investment companies and investment advisers registered with the SEC to adopt written policies and procedures for incident response programs to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information. The amended Regulation S-P also requires covered entities to notify, within 30\u00a0days, individuals affected by an incident involving sensitive customer information and provide them with details about the incident and other information intended to help affected individuals respond appropriately.\n\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity and Item 1C. Cybersecurity for a further discussion of risk management strategies and governance processes related to cybersecurity.\n\nClimate-Related and Other ESG Developments\n\nIn recent years, federal, state and international lawmakers and regulators have increased their focus on financial institutions' and other companies' risk oversight, disclosures and practices in connection with climate change and other environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. In addition, several states, including Texas, have enacted or proposed statutes or regulations addressing climate change and other ESG issues, including \u201canti-ESG\u201d statutes or regulations.\n\nFuture Legislation and Regulation\n\nCongress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although any change could impact the regulatory structure under which we or our competitors operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. It could also affect our competitors differently than us, including in a manner that would make them more competitive. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Cullen/Frost or any of its subsidiaries could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n18\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2024, we employed 5,854\u00a0full-time equivalent employees. At that date, the average tenure of all of our full-time employees was approximately 9.3\u00a0years while the average tenure of our executive officers was approximately 30.4\u00a0years. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations to be good.\n\nOversight of our corporate culture is an important element of our board of director\u2019s oversight of risk because our people are critical to the success of our corporate strategy. Our board sets the \u201ctone at the top,\u201d and holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining, and communicating our culture to employees. In that regard, our culture is designed to promote our commitment to making people's lives better and to uphold that principle in everything we do. That commitment has been a central pillar in our approach to our employees, our planet and the communities we have proudly served for over 150\u00a0years. Our culture is designed to adhere to the timeless values of integrity, caring and excellence. In keeping with that culture, we expect our people to treat each other and our customers with the highest level of honesty and respect and go out of their way to do the right thing, and we strive to be a force for good in everyday life. We dedicate resources to promote a safe workplace; attract, develop and retain talented employees; promote a culture of integrity, caring and excellence; and reward and recognize employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them. We also seek to design careers that are fulfilling ones, with competitive compensation and benefits alongside a positive work-life balance. We also dedicate resources to fostering professional and personal growth with continuing education, on-the-job training and development programs. This commitment to our people has earned us a spot on Forbes magazine's Best Employers list in 2024.\n\nOur employees are key to our success as an organization. We are committed to providing equal opportunity to and avoiding unlawful discrimination against all applicants and employees and attracting, retaining and promoting top quality talent regardless of personal aspects such as sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, national origin and age. We are dedicated to providing a workplace for our employees that is supportive, and free of any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment; rewarding and recognizing our employees based on their individual results and performance as well as that of their department and the company overall; and recognizing and respecting all of the characteristics and differences that make each of our employees unique.\n\nBy promoting and fostering a workforce that we believe is reflective of the values of our customers and communities, we seek to better understand the financial needs of our prospects and customers and provide them with relevant financial service products. This enables us to better serve our customers and communities, enhancing our success as an organization. Understanding and supporting our community has always been a priority to us. We have established a voluntary, employee-led and staffed team that is committed to touching and improving the lives of people that live and work in our community. Additionally, we provide employees the opportunity to use paid time off to perform community service activities in their choice of ways. In 2024, this amounted to over 24,000 hours of community service performed by our employees. Our efforts are designed to enrich the lives of not only those that are in need but also the lives of our employees who participate in these meaningful and rewarding opportunities.\n\n19\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ifa144ed2fb0d4c8cb831330175a52022_7)\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\n\nThe names, ages, recent business experience and positions or offices held by each of the executive officers of Cullen/Frost are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Name and Position Held | | | Age | | | Recent Business Experience | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Phillip D.
