Wintrust expects each of its employees to embody that original mission by serving as brand ambassadors each day, within each community served by our banks and other business units.\n\nWorkforce Overview\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, Wintrust employed 5,903 full-time equivalent employees in the U.S. and Canada. 98% of Wintrust\u2019s employees are classified as full-time, working greater than 30 hours per week. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our employee relations to be good.\n\nTalent Recruiting and Retention\n\nAt Wintrust we recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. In 2024, Wintrust filled over 1,390 positions, including external hires, internal transfers/promotions, and temporary hires. In 2024, 53% of our new hires self-identified as female and 41% of our new hires self-identified as a racial or ethnic minority. Wintrust promotes an employee referral program, which we believe favorably influences colleague retention and engagement. Turnover for the entire Wintrust enterprise for the year was approximately 12% and of that voluntary departures accounted for approximately 75% of the total turnover.\n\nWintrust offers a robust total rewards package that is designed to attract, motivate and retain a talented and inclusive group of employees. In addition to competitive, performance-based compensation plans, we provide employees with comprehensive benefits packages. Wintrust consistently monitors and adapts its total rewards program design to reflect both market changes and employee feedback.\n\nInclusion\n\nWintrust strives to promote an inclusive culture where each employee can be successful, and one that is reflective of the communities we serve. Women currently represent 56% of Wintrust\u2019s workforce. In addition, the racial and ethnic representation in Wintrust\u2019s workforce is 33%. To further support inclusion across Wintrust, we have taken the following steps:\n\n\u2022Continued the \u201cshared responsibility in action\u201d theme with Paired To Win: Mentoring, a program launched in 2023 designed to enable access to mentoring for all employees across the enterprise. Over 1,300 Wintrust employees participated in the mentoring program and 33% of participants were minorities.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | 21 | | |  | | |\n\n---\n\n\u2022Continued our Paired To Win: Advocacy program, which is open to all employees, pairs select high-potential prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with senior executive advocates. The third cohort launched in 2024, and includes over 73% women and 13% minority mid-level leaders. The program objective is to accelerate development of leadership opportunities for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s within one to three years after launching the partnership. As an outcome of the program, 48% of the proteges from the inaugural cohort have been promoted.\n\n\u2022Continued to offer and support Business Resource Groups (\u201cBRG\u201d) to all employees to help foster a sense of belonging and recognizing the value of creating an inclusive and supportive workplace for all of our employees. Our BRGs consist of Leadership Coalition, Multicultural Professionals Network, Career Navigation, Prism, and Women of Wintrust. Approximately 23% of Wintrust employees have registered as members of one or more BRG.\n\n\u2022Continued the 360\u00b0 Inclusivity Model, a multicultural marketing framework for addressing the unique needs of an increasingly diverse marketplace by taking inclusive approaches to eradicating financial disparities in the communities we serve, through access to products and services.\n\n\u2022Supported each of our business units as they update their Business Unit Action Plans, documenting key goals and effective efforts towards fostering inclusion internally and externally in a relevant and intentional way. The Business Unit Action Plan is updated annually and reviewed by senior leaders and the Board of Directors.\n\nLearning & Development\n\nWe are committed to providing all team members with development opportunities through individual and career development planning. Our employees have access to approximately 500 Banking topics, 200 Professional Skills topics and 770 customized training courses and resources through Wintrust University \u2013 our learning portal. In 2024, we maintained an online training catalog containing over 21,000 course offerings for our employees\u2019 personal and professional development and, in 2024, invested more than 177,000 total hours in training by team members.\n\nWe routinely identify and recognize talented employees by performing comprehensive reviews of leadership capability, readiness, aspiration and succession planning. To support the development of our internal talent pipeline, we have invested in a number of programs to support the development of future leaders and additional training for senior leaders with strategic accountability. To support the development of future leaders, over 425 leaders participated in at least one of our leadership development programs in 2024. We also developed the \u201cLeadership Journey\u201d, an eight-phase program that supports our leaders at every phase of their advancement.\n\nAnnually, Wintrust team members at all levels certify their completion of regulatory training based upon their roles and responsibilities. They also are encouraged to complete a minimum of two professional development activities each year.\n\nClimate Impact\n\nThe Company\u2019s approach in considering its climate impact is currently focused on mitigating the environmental impact of operations, specifically at its various banking locations; assessing other climate-related risks within the Company\u2019s various businesses; and providing support to projects and investments that contribute to climate solutions. In 2024, some of the highlights of this approach included the following:\n\n\u2022The Company continued to monitor the climate impact of its various banking locations, including its corporate campus that consists of three office buildings located in Rosemont, Illinois. In 2024, the corporate campus green house gas carbon emissions (CO2e) totaled 3,692 tons in 2024 compared to 3,938 tons in 2023. The Company also measures green house gas carbon emissions (CO2e) at a majority of its retail banking locations and the aggregate measurement of such emissions from the Company\u2019s corporate campus and the retail banking locations totaled 17,699 tons in 2024 related to 187 locations compared to 18,607 tons in 2023 related to 181 locations.\n\n\u2022The Company continued to pursue certain renewable energy solutions as well as efficient building standards and technologies.\n\n\u2022GLA executes investing through its Climate Opportunities strategy (which began in 2013) as well as additional client portfolios which emphasize climate considerations.
