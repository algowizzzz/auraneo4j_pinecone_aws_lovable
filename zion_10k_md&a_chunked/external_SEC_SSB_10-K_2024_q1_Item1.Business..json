We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association (the \u201cBank\u201d), a national banking association, from our headquarters branch in Winter Haven, Florida and, as of December\u00a031, 2023, a 251-branch network located throughout Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. In addition, the Company operates SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. We do not engage in any significant operations other than the ownership of our banking subsidiary.\n\n\u200b\n\nThrough the Bank, we operate a correspondent banking and capital markets service division for over 1,200 small and medium sized community financial institutions throughout the United States. Based primarily in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama, this division earns commissions on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. In addition, the Bank operates SouthState|DuncanWilliams Securities Corp. (\u201cSouthState|DuncanWilliams\u201d), a full-service broker dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, which it acquired in February 2021. The services offered by SouthState|DuncanWilliams are complementary to the Bank\u2019s correspondent banking and capital markets businesses and provide additional opportunities to the Bank\u2019s client base. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, which offers support to the Bank\u2019s Wealth line of business. The Bank owns Corporate Billing, LLC (\u201cCorporate Billing\u201d), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. CBI Holding Company, LLC, Corporate Billing\u2019s previous holding company, and its subsidiary, CBI Real Estate Holding, LLC, were merged into Corporate Billing effective November 30, 2023. In late 2023, the Bank formed SSB First Street Corporation, an investment subsidiary headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, to hold tax-exempt municipal investment securities as part of the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio.\n\n\u200b\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, we had approximately $44.9\u00a0billion in assets, $32.4\u00a0billion in loans, $37.0\u00a0billion in deposits, $5.5\u00a0billion in shareholders\u2019 equity, and a market capitalization of approximately $6.4\u00a0billion.\n\n\u200b\n\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia corporation (\u201cAtlantic Capital\u201d or \u201cACBI\u201d), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the ACBI Merger Agreement, (i) ACBI merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the \u201cACBI Merger\u201d), and (ii) immediately following the ACBI Merger, Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A.
