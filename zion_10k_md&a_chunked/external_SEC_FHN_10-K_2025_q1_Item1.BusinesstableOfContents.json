    "text": "In 2016 federal agencies proposed rules which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions. The proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size. Institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect. If interpreted aggressively by the regulators, the proposed rules could be used to prevent, as a practical matter, larger institutions from engaging in certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm. In the 2016 proposal, the top two tiers included institutions with more\n\nthan $50 billion of assets. We and the Bank currently would fall into the lower of those top two tiers. However, prompted by post-2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory asset-size tiers, if this proposal were finalized today, the $50 billion floor might be raised, allowing us to remain in the third tier.\n\nFour of the six federal agencies who proposed the 2016 rules, but not the Federal Reserve, re-proposed those rules in 2024. We cannot predict what final rules may be adopted, nor how they may be implemented.\n\nEffect of Government Policies & Proposals\n\nThe Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI, and the CFPB. See Supervision and Regulation beginning on page [21](#ia2e92a75fac2412bbb8075ce9e38ea26_40) for additional information.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also sets and manages monetary policy for the U.S. In this latter role, the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate from Congress is to pursue price stability and full employment.\n\nAmong the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions; changes in the rate paid on banks\u2019 required and excess reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve; and changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. These instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result\n\nof actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of our operations, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings. Additional information concerning monetary policy changes appears: under the caption Monetary Policy Shifts within the Significant Business Developments section of Item 1, which begins on page [12](#ia2e92a75fac2412bbb8075ce9e38ea26_28); under the caption Risks Associated with Monetary Events beginning on page [37](#ia2e92a75fac2412bbb8075ce9e38ea26_67) within Item 1A; and under the caption Inflation, Recession, and Federal Reserve Policy within the Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends section of our 2024 MD&A (Item 7), which begins on page [97](#ia2e92a75fac2412bbb8075ce9e38ea26_394).\n\nBills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress, the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and financial condition.\n\nWe are not able to predict what, if any, changes that Congress, state legislatures, or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future, nor the impact that those actions will have upon us.\n\nSources & Availability of Funds\n\nInformation concerning the sources and availability of funds for our businesses can be found in our 2024 MD&A (Item 7), including the subsection entitled Liquidity Risk Management beginning on page [93](#ia2e92a75fac2412bbb8075ce9e38ea26_379), which material is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| First Horizon image.jpg | | | 30 | | | 2024 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT | | |\n\n---"
