    "text": "Organization\n\nEast West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as \u201cEast West\u201d and on a consolidated basis as the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cEWBC\u201d) is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of East West Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), which became its principal asset. East West\u2019s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and other banking or banking-related subsidiaries that East West may establish or acquire. The Company operates in more than 120 locations in the U.S. and Greater China. In the U.S., the Bank\u2019s corporate headquarters and main administrative offices are located in California, and its branches are located in California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia, Massachusetts and Nevada. The Bank has a banking subsidiary based in China - East West Bank (China) Limited.\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, the Company had $52.16 billion in total assets, $37.77 billion in total loans (including loans held-for-sale, net of allowance), $44.86 billion in total deposits, and $5.27 billion in total stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Bank continues to develop its international banking presence with its network of overseas branches and representative offices that include four full-service branches in Greater China, located in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen. The Bank also has four representative offices in Greater China, located in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Xiamen. In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade financing to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients and to develop new business relationships. Through these branches and offices, the Bank is focused on growing its cross-border client base between the U.S. and Greater China, helping U.S. based businesses expand in Greater China and companies based in Greater China pursue business opportunities in the U.S.\n\nThe Bank believes that its customers benefit from the Bank\u2019s understanding of the Greater China markets through its physical presence, corporate and organizational ties in Greater China, as well as the Bank\u2019s international banking products and services. The Bank believes that this approach, combined with its senior management\u2019s and Board of Directors\u2019 extensive ties to Chinese business opportunities and Chinese-American communities, provides the Bank with a competitive advantage. The Bank utilizes its presence in Greater China to identify and build corporate relationships, which the Bank may leverage to create business opportunities in California and other U.S. markets.\n\nThe Bank continues to explore opportunities to establish other foreign offices, subsidiaries, strategic investments and partnerships to expand its international banking capabilities and to capitalize on long-term cross-border business opportunities between the U.S. and Greater China.\n\nBanking Services\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, the Bank was the fourth largest independent commercial bank headquartered in California based on total assets. The Bank is the largest bank in the U.S. focused on the financial service needs of individuals and businesses that operate both in the U.S. and Greater China. The Bank also has a strong focus on the Chinese-American community. Through its network of over 120 banking locations in the U.S. and Greater China, the Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services to businesses and individuals. The Bank provides services to its customers in English and in over 10 other languages. In addition to offering traditional deposit products that include personal and business checking and savings accounts, money market, and time deposits, the Bank also offers foreign exchange, treasury management, and wealth management services. The Bank\u2019s lending activities include commercial and residential real estate, lines of credit, construction, trade finance, letters of credit, commercial business, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending and equipment financing. In addition, the Bank is focused on providing financing to clients in need of a financial bridge to facilitate their business transactions between the U.S. and Greater China.\n\nThe integration of digital channels and brick and mortar channels has been our focus, and an area of investment for the bank, for both commercial and consumer banking platforms. Our strategic priorities include the use of technology to innovate and expand commercial payments and treasury management products and services. We are also developing a digital consumer banking platform to enhance our customer user experience and offer a full suite of banking services tailored to our customers\u2019 unique needs. The omnichannel banking service approach increases efficiency, enables us to provide a better customer experience and deepen customer relationships.\n\n5\n\n---\n\nOperating Segments\n\nThe Bank\u2019s three operating segments, (1) Consumer and Business Banking, (2) Commercial Banking and (3) Other, are based on the Bank\u2019s core strategy. The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company\u2019s domestic branch network. The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. The remaining centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, are aggregated and included in the Other segment. For complete discussion and disclosure, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) \u2014 Operating Segment Results and Note 18 \u2014 Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company faces intense competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions and numerous other providers of financial services. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, quality and range of products and services offered, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of customers and locations served. The Company is a leader of banking market share among the Chinese-American community, and maintains a differentiated presence within selected markets by providing cross-border expertise to customers in a number of industry specializations between the U.S. and Greater China.\n\nWhile the Company believes it is well positioned within a highly competitive industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continuing consolidation.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs a company that delivers relationship-driven financial solutions to a diverse customer base, we believe that the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop quality talent, who we reward through competitive pay and benefits. To achieve these objectives, our human resource programs have been designed based on our core values and attributes which include absolute integrity, customer-centric principles, creativity, respect, teamwork, expertise, and selflessness. These core values and attributes are used to prepare our employees for leadership positions and to advance their careers. East West is committed to promoting diversity in employment and advancement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,200 full-time equivalent employees, of which 220 are in China and Hong Kong. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nEast West Bank was founded in 1973 in Chinatown, Los Angeles, California as a savings & loan association for immigrants who were underserved by mainstream banks, and, as such, we have a long history of, and commitment to, diversity and inclusion. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had grown to be the largest FDIC-insured, minority-operated depository institution headquartered in the continental United States, serving communities with diverse ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds in seven states across the nation. Our operations are concentrated in areas that include larger numbers of immigrants and minorities. We proudly offer financing for affordable housing, provide community development loans, and partner with a diverse list of nonprofit and community-based organizations to promote wealth generation and entrepreneurship in underserved communities. Throughout our history, the diversity of our employees has been essential to successfully grow customer relationships.\n\nOur commitment to diversity is reflected in the composition of our employees. In 2020, 74% of the Company\u2019s employees are Asian or Asian-American, 15% are other minorities of color, and 11% are Caucasian. Nearly two-thirds of our employees are women. Our managers are equally as diverse as our employees: 75% of our managers are Asian or Asian-American and 11% are other minorities of color, and 57% of our managers are women. In addition, given our diverse customer base and the diversity of the communities that we serve, our retail bankers are able to assist customers in English and in over 10 other languages.\n\nThe composition of our Board of Directors exemplifies our commitment to diversity. Of our eight directors, six are minorities, representing four ethnic groups, and three are women.\n\n6\n\n---\n\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Promotion\n\nWe endeavor to attract, retain and develop diverse talent as part of our ongoing commitment to building a stronger workforce to serve our customers and communities. We offer a total compensation package, including salary, benefits and incentive pay, which is competitive with those offered by our peers in the businesses and markets where we operate. We are committed to fair and equitable compensation programs, and regularly assess the current business environment and labor markets to review our compensation and benefits programs for pay equity.\n\nTo foster a strong sense of ownership and to align the interests of our employees with our shareholders, restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees under our stock incentive programs. We award stock grants under our \u201cSpirit of Ownership\u201d program to all of our employees, regardless of job title or part-time/full-time status. The program allows each employee to share directly in the success they help create. The fact that our employees are also owners is a source of pride for EWBC.\n\nWe recognize the importance of employee development and career growth in achieving personal development for our employees and also the Company\u2019s strategic objectives. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills for future advancement, including tuition reimbursement and a management trainee program. Our success in talent development is evident by our internal promotions into leadership positions.\n\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\n\nWe are committed to supporting our employees\u2019 well-being by offering flexible and competitive benefits. Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to employees working at least 30 hours or more each week. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered a variety of programs and benefits designed to promote employee wellness. In addition, we encourage our employees to engage with our local communities by leading or participating in events to foster community and development, as COVID-19 safety protocols permit. Based on the guidance from health authorities regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided resources and implemented measures to limit the risk of exposure to our employees, and the communities in which they live and work.

Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) administered by the FDIC, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our investors. As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and, with respect to consumer laws, the CFPB. As insurer of the Bank\u2019s deposits, the FDIC has back-up examination authority of the Bank as well. In addition, the Bank is regulated by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we now, or may in the future wish to conduct business, including China and Hong Kong.\n\n7\n\n---\n\nThe Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol \u201cEWBC\u201d and subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies. The Company is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n\nDescribed below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nEast West\n\nAs a bank holding company and pursuant to its election of financial holding company status, East West is subject to regulation, supervision, and examinations by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The BHC Act provides a federal framework for the regulation and supervision of all bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The BHC Act and other federal statutes grant the Federal Reserve authority to, among other things:\n\n\u2022require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion;\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (see Item 1. Business \u2014 Supervision and Regulation \u2014 Capital Requirements);\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank, including at times when bank holding companies may not be inclined to do so, and the failure to do so generally may be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or both;\n\n\u2022restrict dividends and other distributions from subsidiary banks to their parent bank holding companies;\n\n\u2022require bank holding companies to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain nonbank subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity or the control of the nonbank subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company, or if the activity, ownership, or control is inconsistent with the purposes of the BHC Act;\n\n\u2022regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and requiring a bank holding company to obtain prior approval to purchase or redeem its securities in certain situations;\n\n\u2022approve in advance senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit (under certain circumstances) golden parachute payments to officers and employees, including change in control agreements and new employment agreements, that are contingent upon termination; and\n\n\u2022approve in advance acquisitions of and mergers with bank holding companies, banks and other financial companies, and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. DFPI approval may also be required for certain acquisitions and mergers involving a California-chartered bank such as the Bank.\n\nEast West\u2019s election to be a financial holding company as permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (\u201cGLBA\u201d), generally allows East West to engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any such activity, without prior Federal Reserve approval. Activities that are considered to be financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, merchant banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. To maintain financial holding company status and continue to be able to engage in new activities or investments that are financial in nature, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d, and the financial holding company\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries must have Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) records of at least \u201csatisfactory.\u201d A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned \u201cCapital Requirements\u201d and \u201cPrompt Corrective Action,\u201d included elsewhere under this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered \u201cwell managed\u201d if it received a composite rating and a management rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent examination. See the section captioned \u201cCommunity Reinvestment Act\u201d included elsewhere under this item. As of December\u00a031, 2020, East West is a financial holding company and has financial subsidiaries, as discussed in Item 1. Business \u2014 Organization.\n\n8\n\n---\n\nThe Bank and its Subsidiaries\n\nEast West Bank is a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank\u2019s operations in the U.S. are primarily regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, and its activities outside the U.S. are regulated and supervised by both its U.S. regulators and the applicable regulatory authority in the host country in which each overseas office is located. Specific federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, their regulatory capital levels, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. Bank regulatory agencies also have extensive discretion to impose various restrictions on management or operations and to issue policies and guidance in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state-chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. The Bank may also form subsidiaries to engage in the many activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries. Further, pursuant to the GLBA, the Bank may conduct certain \u201cfinancial\u201d activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d and has a CRA rating of at least \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\n\nRegulation of Subsidiaries and Branches\n\nThe Bank\u2019s foreign-based subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. East West Bank\u2019s Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong.\n\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe federal banking agencies have imposed risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d) establishing a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that became effective for the Company and the Bank beginning January 1, 2015. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital, include a required ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital to risk-weighted assets and restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in Tier 1 and 2 capital (including by phasing out trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies). The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting assets and include a number of risk weighting categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, to be considered adequately capitalized, standardized approach banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of at least 4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0% total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets and a 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% that fully phased in on January 1, 2019, on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Banking institutions with a risk-based capital ratio that meets or exceeds the minimum requirement but does not meet the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. To avoid these constraints, a banking organization must meet or exceed the following risk-based capital ratios (after any distribution): (i) CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.5%, and (iii) total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.5%.\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy requirements of the federal banking agencies, including the capital conservation buffer, and the Company and the Bank were classified as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For additional discussion and disclosure see Item 7. MD&A \u2014 Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 17 \u2014 Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nThe Bank is also subject to additional capital requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d) regulations that implement Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\u201cFDIA\u201d), as discussed below under the Prompt Corrective Action section.\n\n9\n\n---\n\nRecent Regulatory Capital-Related Developments\n\nFrom time to time, the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. Such proposals and interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our regulatory capital requirements and reported capital ratios.\n\nIn July 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule (the \u201cCapital Simplifications Rule\u201d) to reduce regulatory compliance burden by simplifying certain risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules for non-advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposures), including the Company and the Bank. The Capital Simplifications Rule became effective for the Company and the Bank on April 1, 2020. Application of the Capital Simplifications Rule to our consolidated balance sheet did not have a significant impact on the capital ratios of the Company and the Bank.\n\nIn light of the recent disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies have also revised the definition of eligible retained income to be the greater of (1) a banking organization\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (2) the average of a banking organization\u2019s net income over the preceding four quarters. This revision reduces the likelihood that a banking organization is suddenly subject to abrupt and restrictive distribution limitations in a scenario where its capital ratios fall below an applicable minimum risk-based capital ratio requirement plus capital conservation buffer, and instead makes the application of these limitations more gradual. The revision became effective on March 20, 2020.\n\nIn April 2020, in recognition of the CARES Act requirements and to facilitate the use of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d), the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to exclude from risk-based and leverage capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis through the PPPLF. The interim final rule states that PPP loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP will be risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes and PPP loans pledged as collateral to PPPLF may be excluded from the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio. In addition, the CARES Act, the banking agencies\u2019 \u201cInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customer Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)\u201d (the \u201cInteragency Statement\u201d) issued on March 22, 2020 and April 7, 2020, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the \u201cCAA\u201d), enacted December 27, 2020, provided options for financial institutions to elect to temporarily suspend troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDR\u201d) accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Subtopic 310-40. For additional information, see Note 1 \u2014 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Troubled Debt Restructurings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The election to apply the TDR relief under these regulatory guidance provided banking organizations such as the Bank a capital benefit by increasing its regulatory capital ratios as the loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic are not adjusted to a higher risk weighting normally associated with a TDR classification.\n\nIn December 2018, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting, including with respect to banking organizations\u2019 implementation of the Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13 Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology. The final rule among other things provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020, the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay (i.e., a five-year transition, in total). The Company adopted the five-year transition in 2020. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital will be delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects will be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024.\n\n10\n\n---\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe FDIA, as amended, requires federal banking agencies to take PCA with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d A depository institution\u2019s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. Under the federal banking agencies\u2019 regulations implementing the PCA provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution generally is classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| PCA Category | | |  | | | Risk-Based Capital Ratios | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | Total Capital | | |  | | | Tier 1 Capital | | |  | | | CET1 Capital | | |  | | | Tier 1 Leverage | | |\n| Well capitalized (1) | | |  | | | \u2265 10% | | |  | | | \u2265 8% | | |  | | | \u2265 6.5% | | |  | | | \u2265 5% | | |\n| Adequately capitalized | | |  | | | \u2265 8% | | |  | | | \u2265 6% | | |  | | | \u2265 4.5% | | |  | | | \u2265 4% | | |\n| Undercapitalized | | |  | | | < 8% | | |  | | | < 6% | | |  | | | < 4.5% | | |  | | | < 4% | | |\n| Significantly undercapitalized | | |  | | | < 6% | | |  | | | < 4% | | |  | | | < 3.0% | | |  | | | < 3% | | |\n| Critically undercapitalized | | |  | | | Tangible Equity/Total Assets \u2264 2% | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n(1)Additionally, to be classified as well capitalized, an insured depository institution may not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or PCA directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\n\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank\u2019s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank\u2019s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\n\nThe FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of any dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and/or restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits. \u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIA also generally permits only \u201cwell capitalized\u201d insured depository institutions to accept brokered deposits, however an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution may apply to the FDIC for a waiver of this restriction.\n\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Act and Stress Testing\n\nIn May 2018, the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) amended certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes administered by the Federal Reserve. Amongst other things, the EGRRCPA provided regulatory relief, including from risk committee requirements, for bank holding companies and state member banks with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. We were among the bank holding companies and banks in this range until we exceeded $50 billion in total consolidated assets as of September 30, 2020.\n\nThe EGRRCPA also lifted the asset size threshold and provided relief for banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion with respect to many of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential standards, except for the risk committee requirements. The EGRRCPA also raised the asset size threshold for required company-run stress testing at banks and bank holding companies from $10 billion to $250 billion. Additionally, based on authority provided in the EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve raised the asset size threshold for required supervisory stress testing at bank holding companies from $50 billion to $100 billion. Although the Company and the Bank are not required to conduct stress tests, we continue to conduct annual capital and quarterly liquidity stress tests.\n\n11\n\n---\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the authority to implement, examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions and certain other companies. The CFPB has exclusive authority to examine insured depository institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion (such as the Bank) and their affiliates with respect to these consumer financial laws, and may also take enforcement action. The CFPB may focus its supervisory, examination, and enforcement efforts on, among other things:\n\n\u2022risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when evaluating the policies and practices of a financial institution;\n\n\u2022unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, which the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the CFPB to prevent through rulemaking, enforcement and examination;\n\n\u2022rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Billing Act; and\n\n\u2022the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets.\n\nThe statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting payments on loans and providing other services.\u00a0Failure to comply with these laws can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages or restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights.\u00a0The Company and the Bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Reserve Requirements\n\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of San Francisco. As a FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access the FHLB for both short-term and long-term secured credit.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve. On March 26, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all deposit institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. The Bank is also a member bank and stockholder of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\u201cFRBSF\u201d).\n\nDividends and Other Transfers of Funds\n\nThe principal source of liquidity of East West is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies have an authority to prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank\u2019s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal PCA regime, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company\u2019s bank subsidiary is classified as \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or, in some circumstances, \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d It is the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the company\u2019s net income available to common stockholders over the past four quarters, net of distributions, would be sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy that a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company\u2019s ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations\u2019 financial condition and compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.\n\n12\n\n---\n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\n\nPursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that strictly limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their parent bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve limit the types, terms and amounts of these transactions and generally require the transactions to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d which include bank\u2019s extensions of credit to or purchase of assets from an affiliate, be limited to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital and surplus with respect to any one affiliate, and 20% of the bank\u2019s capital and surplus with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates. In addition, a bank generally may not extend credit to an affiliate unless the extension of credit is secured by specified amounts of collateral. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions, including by treating derivative transactions resulting in a bank\u2019s credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as \u201cSuper 23A\u201d and \u201cSuper 23B\u201d) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund.\n\nFederal law also limits a bank\u2019s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank\u2019s capital.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nUnder the CRA, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates a state member bank\u2019s performance under applicable performance criteria and assign a rating of \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial noncompliance.\u201d The Federal Reserve takes this performance into account when reviewing applications by banks and their parent companies to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or acquire other financial institutions. Unsatisfactory CRA performance may result in the denial of such applications. On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that invites the public to comment on its proposal to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better meet the core purpose of the CRA. The impact on the Company from any changes in CRA regulations will depend on how they are implemented and applied.\n\nFDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe FDIC insures the Bank\u2019s customer deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly insurance assessments on insured banks based on their assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC\u2019s fund management authority by establishing a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio of 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The Bank\u2019s DIF quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate. The assessment rate is calculated based on an institution\u2019s risk profile, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank\u2019s failure.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30 percent, below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent. The decline in the ratio was due to extraordinary insured deposit growth, which was resulted mainly from the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically monetary policy action, direct government assistance to the consumers and businesses, and an overall reduction in spending. The FDIC projects that the DIF reserve ratio would return to 1.35 percent without further action by the FDIC and has continued to maintain existing schedule of assessment rates.\n\n13\n\n---\n\nIn June 2020, the FDIC published a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP, PPPLF and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (\u201cMMLF\u201d). Under the rule, the FDIC provided adjustments to the risk based premium formula and certain of its risk ratios, and an offset to an insured institution\u2019s total assessment amount due for the increase to its assessment base attributable to participation in the PPP and MMLF. Absent such a change to the assessment rules, an insured depository institution could have become subject to increased deposit insurance assessments based on its participation in the PPP, PPPLF or MMLF programs. This final rule became effective on April 1, 2020, which applied the changes to deposit insurance assessments starting in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution\u2019s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, condition, or order imposed by the FDIC.\n\nBank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d), USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (\u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d), federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls, which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory agencies expect that the Bank will have an effective governance structure for the program which includes effective oversight by our Board of Directors and management. We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to comply with the PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which became law in January 2021, made a number of changes to anti-money laundering laws, including increasing penalties for anti-money laundering violations. The Bank regularly evaluates and continues to enhance its systems and procedures to ensure compliance with the regulations.\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. financial institutions do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. Banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with regulations administered by the OFAC for economic sanctions against designated foreign countries, designated nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank.\n\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\n\nFederal statutes and regulations require banking organizations to take certain actions to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has prepared a privacy policy that it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer\u2019s consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank\u2019s sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. Additional conditions affect the Bank\u2019s information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank's privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are subjects covered in the Federal Reserve\u2019s periodic compliance examinations.\n\nConsumer data privacy and data protection are also the subject of state laws. For example, on January 1, 2020, the Bank became subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). This statute grants consumers several rights, including the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. However, a consumer does not have these rights with respect to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA or the California Financial Information Privacy Act. The California Attorney General has adopted regulations to implement the CCPA.\n\n14\n\n---\n\nThe Federal Reserve pays close attention to the cybersecurity practices of state member banks and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d), has issued a number of policy statements and other guidance for banks in light of the growing threat posed by cybersecurity threats. FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials, cyber resilience and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution\u2019s information technology and its ability to thwart or mitigate cyber-attacks. Additionally, on December 18, 2020, the federal banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator within 36 hours of a significant cybersecurity incident.\n\nFuture Legislation and Regulation\n\nNew statutes, regulations and policies that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions and public companies operating in the U.S. are regularly adopted. Such changes to applicable status, regulations and policies may change the Company\u2019s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase the Company\u2019s cost of conducting business, impede the efficiency of the internal business processes, and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage. Accordingly, such changes may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. We cannot predict whether or in what form any statute, regulation or policy will be proposed or adopted or the extent to which our businesses may be affected by any new statute or regulation."
