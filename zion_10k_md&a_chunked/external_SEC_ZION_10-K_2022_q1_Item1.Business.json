We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We have more than one million customers, served by our 418 branches at year-end 2021. We had 9,685 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2021. At year end, we had a strong capital position, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.2%, which is considered well capitalized under regulatory definitions.\n\nWe conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, and pricing; and customization of certain products (as applicable) designed to maximize customer\n\n4\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\nsatisfaction and strengthen community relations. For further information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d on page 40 in Management's Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe focus on serving our customers and communities. Our experienced bankers develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nSome of the products and services we provide include:\n\n\u2022Commercial business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large corporations, supported by our high-quality treasury, cash management, and digital banking products and services. Specialties within our commercial business banking include:\n\n\u25e6Municipal and public finance services\n\n\u25e6Merchant and payment processing services\n\n\u25e6Corporate cards\n\n\u25e6Capital markets, syndication, and foreign exchange services\n\n\u25e6Term real estate lending\n\n\u25e6Construction and land development lending\n\n\u2022Retail banking. We have a strong retail banking business in several of our markets, with competitive products and top-quality online and mobile offerings, focused on serving consumers and small businesses. Our retail banking products and services include:\n\n\u25e6Residential mortgages\n\n\u25e6Home equity lines of credit\n\n\u25e6Personal lines of credit and installment consumer loans\n\n\u25e6Depository account services\n\n\u25e6Consumer cards\n\n\u25e6Personal trust services\n\n\u2022Wealth management and private client banking. We offer various wealth management solutions to customers, which is one of the fastest growing segments of our company. Our planning-driven offerings combined with high-touch service and sophisticated asset management capabilities have resulted in substantial growth in assets under management. We also offer advanced business succession and estate planning services to our most complex business customers, helping prepare them for important transitions.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services such as mortgage banking, merchant services, and payment processing comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, and financial technology companies. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, financial technology companies (\u201cfintech\u201d), other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens.\n\nOur key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of office locations, online banking functionality and other delivery methods, a wide range of products and services\n\n5\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\noffered, and the overall relationship with our clients. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nThis section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers and taxpayers. These regulations are not generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We are also subject to examination and supervision by the OCC and examination by the CFPB in respect of federal consumer financial regulations. We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.\n\nThe National Bank Act\n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act, but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held corporations.\n\nThe National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including robust capital standards, prompt corrective action requirements, and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.\n\nCapital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2021, we met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and risk weights, where applicable, and other factors affecting the numerator and denominator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nUnder the Basel III capital rules, the minimum capital ratio requirements are as follows:\n\n\u20224.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\n\u20226.0% Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets;\n\n6\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\n\u20228.0% Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets; and\n\n\u20224.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d).\n\nThe Basel III capital rules also require us to maintain a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of CET1, and in excess of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (3) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nWe utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. Our 2021 internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected the ongoing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the stress test indicated that we would maintain regulatory capital ratios at levels adequate for our risk profile throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test. Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require many banks to adhere to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) process and stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). We are not regulated by the FRB and therefore are not subject to this process. However, we use the FRB's CCAR process, including published economic scenarios, to inform our stress testing activities.\n\nLiquidity\n\nOur liquidity profile remained very strong during 2021. We manage liquidity in accordance with the Basel III liquidity requirements, and we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, maintaining levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities.\n\nFinancial Privacy and Cyber Security\n\nThe federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\n\nState regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have enacted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and have provided detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. In June 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and which was further amended in November 2020 by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d). The CCPA, as amended, covers businesses that obtain or access\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\npersonal information on California residents, grants them enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information, and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to individual data privacy rights. Some of the rights afforded to California residents also extend to California employees, though the CPRA amendments now exempt certain employee information and employer usage from some of the CPRA provisions until at least January 1, 2023. Other states have implemented, or are considering, similar privacy laws. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate.\n\nData and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly, remain a focus of state and federal regulators, are likely to be the subject of future rule making, and will continue to have a significant impact on our risk management practices.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations.\n\nAn institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator add back some language taken out.\n\nOther Regulations\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.\n\n\u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a unaffiliated nonbank. See discussion under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\n\u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions.\n\n\u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.\n\n\u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.\n\n\u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain securities.\n\n\u2022Requirements for opening of branches.\n\n\u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.\n\n\u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.\n\n\u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n\u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.\n\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) market has also enacted corporate governance rules, including director diversity standards, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and the independence, diversity, and effectiveness of their directors.\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) standards and concerns continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by ESG interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to ESG issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, our ongoing monitoring enables us to enhance our business practices by incorporating ESG recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities. We publish a Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address ESG issues. The report is available on our website.\n\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices. This system includes frameworks, policies, and guidelines such as Corporate Governance Guidelines; a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees; a Directors Code of Conduct; a Risk Management Framework; a Related Party Transaction Policy; Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines; a Compensation Clawback Policy; an Insider Trading Policy, including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders; and charters for the Executive, Audit, Risk Oversight, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.

We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on how we work and the work we perform. Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, we successfully transitioned approximately 70% of our employees to working remotely. We implemented additional programs to promote mental health and wellness, as well as policies and procedures to keep our employees safe, including work-from-home arrangements, elevated cleaning standards of our facilities, required masking, and we strongly encourage our employees to be fully vaccinated. We continue to monitor and adjust our policies and procedures to keep our people safe.\n\nAs the pandemic subsides and vaccination rates increase, we look forward to returning to our offices in-person more regularly. We believe that in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture.\n\nThe number of full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2021 totaled 9,685, and remained relatively flat from the prior year period. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our employees at December\u00a031, 2021.\n\nSchedule 1\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | |\n| Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Management | | | 51 | | % |  | | | 27 | | % |  | | | 11 | | % |  | | | 3 | | % |\n| Non-management | | | 60 | | % |  | | | 38 | | % |  | | | 12 | | % |  | | | 2 | | % |\n| Overall | | | 58 | | % |  | | | 35 | | % |  | | | 12 | | % |  | | | 3 | | % |\n\nThe following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:\n\nCultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate\n\nWe believe in an environment where people are respected and valued, regardless of their differences. We also believe that our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees.\n\nWe use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure and retain a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report highlights several achievements in this area. For example, in our 2021 Banker Development Program that attracts and advances undergraduates and early-career professionals, 53% of participants were women and 38% were people of color. Of the participants in our 2021 college internship program, 30% were women and 28% were people of color.\n\nWe have instituted enterprise-wide and affiliate diversity, equity, and inclusion councils; employee business forums; regional inclusion champions; mental health initiatives; and a broad range of employee and community events. Throughout the organization, employee business resource groups foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through forum meetings and discussions, which are open to all\n\n10\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\nemployees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity, both internally and externally.\n\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success\n\nWe are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the markets in which we operate, to helping our employees grow in their careers, and to actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.\n\nWe offer more than 2,000 virtual, in-person, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create tailored learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2021, we hosted more than 900 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Of the participants in our 2021 mentor program, 53% were women and 25% were people of color. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded and successful employees.\n\nWe are also mindful of the increasing competition for talent in the current labor market. Our overall 2021 turnover rates and time-to-fill for vacancies were comparable to the annual rates we experienced prior to the pandemic. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.\n\nRecognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees\n\nWe support a culture of integrity, engagement, and achievement through comprehensive rewards and recognition. Our programs are designed to enhance the employee experience, drive retention, promote recognition, and reward high performance. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.\n\nWe routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. During 2021, we enlisted the services of an independent third party that found after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, women are paid, on average, approximately 99% of what men are paid, and people of color are paid approximately 98% of what white employees are paid.\n\nOur employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\n\nWe value work-life balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental, physical, social, and financial wellness. Some of our key benefits include the following:\n\n\u2022Corporate match for our 401(k) plan of 4.5% of an employee\u2019s salary and incentive compensation;\n\n\u2022Annual profit-sharing contributions;\n\n\u2022Health care plan options including behavioral health, wellness, and autism spectrum disorder services;\n\n\u2022Preventive prescription drug coverage not subject to deductibles;\n\n\u2022Paid parental program allowing time off for mothers, fathers, and domestic partners;\n\n\u2022Adoption assistance program; and\n\n\u2022Paid time off for various community service activities and other volunteer opportunities.\n\n11\n\n---\n\n[Table of Con](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)[tents](#ia3f6fedd67564d3dacc5bc10a51eed92_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION"
