    "text": "GENERAL\n\nOld National is a financial holding company incorporated in the state of Indiana and maintains its principal executive office in Evansville, Indiana.\u00a0\u00a0Through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, we provide a wide range of services, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, private banking, brokerage, trust, investment advisory, and other traditional banking services.\n\nCOMPANY PROFILE\n\nOld National Bank, our wholly-owned banking subsidiary (\u201cOld National Bank\u201d), was founded in 1834 and is the oldest company in Evansville, Indiana.\u00a0\u00a0In 1982, Old National Bancorp was formed; in 2001 we became a financial holding company and we are currently the largest financial holding company headquartered in the state of Indiana with consolidated assets of $23.0 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Old National Bank operated 162 banking centers located primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Each of the banking centers of Old National Bank provide a group of similar community banking services, including such products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, cash management, brokerage, trust, and investment advisory services.\u00a0\u00a0The individual banking centers located throughout our Midwest footprint have similar operating and economic characteristics.\n\nWe earn interest income on loans as well as fee income from the origination of loans.\u00a0\u00a0Lending activities include loans to individuals, which primarily consist of home equity lines of credit, residential real estate loans and consumer loans, and loans to commercial clients, which include commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, letters of credit, and lease financing.\u00a0\u00a0Residential real estate loans are either kept in our loan portfolio or sold to secondary investors, with gains or losses from the sales being recognized.\n\nWe strive to serve individuals and commercial clients by providing depository services that fit their needs at competitive rates.\u00a0\u00a0We pay interest on the interest-bearing deposits and receive service fee revenue on various accounts.\u00a0\u00a0Deposit accounts include products such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing checking and NOW, savings and money market, and time deposits.\u00a0\u00a0Debit and ATM cards provide clients with access to their accounts 24 hours a day at any ATM location.\u00a0\u00a0We also provide 24-hour telephone access and online banking as well as other electronic and mobile banking services.\n\nIn addition to the community banking services of lending and providing deposit services, we offer comprehensive wealth management, investment, and foreign currency services.\u00a0\u00a0For businesses, we provide treasury management, merchant, health savings, and capital markets services as well as community development lending and equity investment solutions intended to produce jobs and revitalize our communities.\n\nIn January 2020, Old National commenced implementation of a strategic plan (\u201cThe ONB Way\u201d), which has various detailed business objectives designed to keep the Company\u2019s clients at the center of all we do.\u00a0\u00a0The ONB Way includes:\n\n\u2022Realigning the organization into clearly defined segments to align leaders and relationship managers with the client segment they can best serve (while not wavering on our commitment to community);\n\n\u2022Deepening client relationships through integrated Commercial, Community Banking, and Wealth teams;\n\n\u2022Simplifying and improving the end-to-end banking/borrowing journey while adhering to strong risk management principles;\n\n\u2022Creating a new Wealth Division that combines wealth management, investments, and private banking for a simplified, highly consultative client experience firmly rooted in financial planning; and\n\n\u2022Investing in our operational and information technology infrastructure to meet our clients \u201cwhere they are\u201d and ensure that we keep pace with technology and client digital expectations.\n\nDuring 2020, we executed The ONB Way transformation, delivered on the run rate expense savings, and are transitioning into the implementation phase of our planned revenue initiatives. These revenue initiatives are underway for our technology, Commercial, Wealth, and Treasury Management areas; while our Community area initiatives are scheduled to commence throughout the remainder of 2021.\n\n5\n\n---\n\nIn July 2020, Old National entered into a multi-year strategic partnership with Infosys Limited, which will enable faster adoption of digital solutions, modernize our technology infrastructure, and enhance both the employee and client experience.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAt December 31, 2020, we employed 2,445 full-time equivalent team members. Old National respects, values, and invites diversity in our team members, customers, suppliers, marketplace, and community. We seek to recognize the unique contribution each individual brings to our company, and we are fully committed to supporting a rich culture of diversity as a cornerstone to our success. Old National provides professional development opportunities to team members and seeks to improve retention, development, and job satisfaction of team members from diverse groups by providing career skills training, peer mentoring, and opportunities to interact with senior leaders.\n\nWe are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members, customers, and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges to maintain team member and client safety while continuing to be open for business. Accordingly, we launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak that included the creation of an internal coronavirus resource page to manage our pandemic response, including providing access to recent safety standards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other agencies; as well as our workplace guidelines for non-customer and customer environments. In addition, current information is shared through regular emails and other digital communications with our team members and customers facing financial hardships due to COVID-19. Additional actions included adjusting our banking center hours, lobby usage, and encouraging team members to work remotely where possible during the pandemic. We continue to monitor our footprint for areas where there is a resurgence or regression of COVID-19 and adjust our banking center availability accordingly. Our banking centers are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes, while our online banking network is continuously available for digital banking transactions. Lastly, the availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine may drive the re-opening plans of state and local economies in 2021. However, economic uncertainty remains high and bouts of elevated volatility are expected to continue.\n\nOld National team members actively share their talents in their communities through volunteer activities in education, economic development, human and health services, and Community Reinvestment. Our ONe Community program allows each team member to be paid up to 24 hours per year, with supervisory approval, to volunteer for activities in their community during normal work hours. During 2020, team members donated nearly 30,000 hours in support of more than 1,500 organizations. Even through a pandemic, Old National team members found creative ways to give back to their communities by donating blood, making masks for healthcare workers, and serving on local boards, just to name a few. Team member volunteers are recognized for their efforts on our Corporate Portal. Team members with 25 hours or more of service each year join the \u201cVolunteer Honor Roll\u201d in Old National\u2019s annual communications.\n\nMARKET AREA\n\nWe own the largest bank headquartered in Indiana.\u00a0\u00a0Operating from a home base in Evansville, Indiana, we have continued to grow our footprint in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\u00a0\u00a0Since the beginning of 2011, Old National has transformed its franchise by reducing low-return businesses and low-growth markets and investing in higher-growth markets.\n\n6\n\n---\n\nThe following table reflects information on the top markets we currently serve, demonstrating that our largest metropolitan statistical areas compare favorably to the national average.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Metropolitan Statistical Area | | | Percent of Old National Bank Franchise (%) | | | Deposits Per Branch ($M) | | | 2010-2021 Population Change (%) | | | 2021-2026 Projected Population Change (%) | | | 2021 Median Household Income ($) | | | 2021-2026 Projected Household Income Change (%) | | |\n| Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI (1) | | | 21.9 | |  | 112.0 | |  | 10.7 | |  | 4.0 | |  | 86,382 | |  | 10.0 | |  |\n| Evansville, IN-KY | | | 18.5 | |  | 177.8 | |  | 1.2 | |  | 0.9 | |  | 59,747 | |  | 10.0 | |  |\n| Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN | | | 8.6 | |  | 63.6 | |  | 11.5 | |  | 3.7 | |  | 66,222 | |  | 8.8 | |  |\n| Madison, WI (1) | | | 5.0 | |  | 48.2 | |  | 11.2 | |  | 3.3 | |  | 78,229 | |  | 11.3 | |  |\n| Bloomington, IN (1) | | | 4.7 | |  | 154.8 | |  | 6.9 | |  | 2.7 | |  | 51,060 | |  | 9.4 | |  |\n| Terre Haute, IN | | | 2.7 | |  | 87.7 | |  | (2.1) | |  | (0.1) | |  | 54,128 | |  | 11.8 | |  |\n| Jasper, IN | | | 2.3 | |  | 63.8 | |  | 0.9 | |  | 1.1 | |  | 64,196 | |  | 7.7 | |  |\n| Fort Wayne, IN (1) | | | 2.3 | |  | 76.2 | |  | 7.5 | |  | 3.1 | |  | 60,922 | |  | 9.5 | |  |\n| Ann Arbor, MI (1) | | | 2.3 | |  | 92.9 | |  | 7.0 | |  | 1.7 | |  | 78,844 | |  | 12.6 | |  |\n| Grand Rapids-Kentwood, MI (1) | | | 2.2 | |  | 73.4 | |  | 9.6 | |  | 2.7 | |  | 68,835 | |  | 10.2 | |  |\n| National average | | |  | | |  | | | 7.2 | |  | 2.9 | |  | 67,761 | |  | 9.0 | |  |\n| Weighted average or sum total \u00a0\u00a0 Old National Bank top 5 | | | 58.6 | |  | 103.2 | |  | 10.5 | |  | 3.7 | |  | 68,328 | |  | 10.0 | |  |\n| Weighted average or sum total \u00a0\u00a0 Old National Bank top 10 | | | 70.5 | |  | 97.8 | |  | 9.8 | |  | 3.4 | |  | 66,857 | |  | 10.2 | |  |\n| (1)\u00a0\u00a0Expansion markets weighted average | | | 38.8 | |  | 93.5 | |  | 9.8 | |  | 3.4 | |  | 69,580 | |  | 10.9 | |  |\n| Weighted average total Old National Bank | | |  | | |  | | | 5.2 | |  | 2.0 | |  | 66,680 | |  | 9.4 | |  |\n\nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE STRATEGY\n\nSince the formation of Old National in 1982, we have acquired over 50 financial institutions and other financial services businesses.\u00a0\u00a0Future acquisitions and divestitures will be driven by a disciplined financial evaluation process and will be consistent with the existing basic banking strategy which focuses on community banking, client relationships, and consistent quality earnings.\u00a0\u00a0Targeted geographic markets for acquisitions include mid-size markets with average to above average growth rates.\n\nWe anticipate that, as with previous acquisitions, the consideration paid by us in future acquisitions may be in the form of cash, debt, or Old National stock, or a combination thereof.\u00a0\u00a0The amount and structure of such consideration is based on reasonable growth and cost savings assumptions and a thorough analysis of the impact on both long- and short-term financial results.\n\nOur most recent acquisitions included the following:\n\n\u2022Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. through a stock and cash consideration merger on May 1, 2016 that added 46 banking centers in the Madison, Milwaukee, and Fox Valley, Wisconsin triangle markets;\n\n\u2022Anchor Bank, N.A., headquartered in the Twin Cities, through a stock and cash consideration merger on November 1, 2017 that added 17 banking centers in Minnesota; and\n\n\u2022Minnesota-based Klein through a 100% stock consideration merger on November 1, 2018 that added 18 banking centers serving the Twin Cities and its western communities in Minnesota.\n\nIn regard to future partnerships, we are growing more confident in our ability to evaluate the fair value of a potential acquisition target\u2019s loan portfolio in the current economic environment. However, we remain an active looker and a selective buyer.\u00a0\u00a0We are patient and continue to wait for advantageous opportunities while we remain focused on execution of our strategies.\n\nDivestitures\n\nOn May 31, 2016, the Company sold its insurance operations, ONB Insurance Group, Inc. (\u201cONI\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The Company received approximately $91.8 million in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41.9 million and an after-tax gain of\n\n7\n\n---\n\n$17.6 million.\u00a0\u00a0Goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $47.5 million were eliminated as part of this transaction.\u00a0\u00a0ONI was an ancillary business and did not meet the criteria to be treated as a discontinued operation as defined in Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d\n\nOn October 26, 2018, the Company divested ten banking centers in Wisconsin to Marine Credit Union of La Crosse, Wisconsin.\u00a0\u00a0At closing, the purchasers assumed $230.6 million in deposits and no loans.\u00a0\u00a0Old National recorded a net pre-tax gain of $14.0 million in connection with the sale, which included a deposit premium of $15.0 million, goodwill allocation of $0.6 million, and $0.4 million of other transaction expenses.\n\nSince the beginning of 2011 through the end of 2020, we have consolidated or sold over 230 banking centers as part of our continued banking center rationalization.\u00a0\u00a0Over the same period, we have more than tripled our assets and have increased our average total deposits per banking center from $34 million to approximately $105 million, while only increasing our number of banking centers by 1 to 162.\n\nAnother component of The ONB Way is the optimization of our banking center network. As part of The ONB Way, we consolidated 31 banking centers scattered throughout the footprint in April 2020, reflecting an ongoing shift among our clients toward digital banking solutions. Many of the facilities consolidated were in smaller markets, several of which were added in recent years through acquisition and partnership activity.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe banking industry and related financial service providers operate in a highly competitive market.\u00a0\u00a0Old National competes with financial service providers such as other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, and other financial intermediaries.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Financial Technology, or \u201cFinTech,\u201d start-ups are emerging in key areas of banking.\n\nMany of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, mergers and acquisitions, advances in technology and product delivery systems, consolidation among financial service providers, bank failures, and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nOld National is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws.\u00a0\u00a0The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors.\n\nSignificant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to Old National and its subsidiaries are described below.\u00a0\u00a0The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described.\u00a0\u00a0Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and subject to change.\u00a0\u00a0A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to Old National and its subsidiaries, for which Old National cannot predict, could have a material effect on the business of the Company.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act.\u00a0\u00a0On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the \u201cDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u201d (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was signed into law.\u00a0\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructured the financial regulatory environment in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all bank holding companies and banks, including Old National and Old National Bank, some of which are described in more detail below.\u00a0\u00a0The scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were determined and issued over time. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Old National has been substantial.\u00a0\u00a0Provisions in the legislation affect the payment of interest on demand deposits, collection of interchange fees associated with certain deposits, and placed limits on certain revenues on those deposits.\n\n8\n\n---\n\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cEconomic Growth Act\u201d), which was enacted in May 2018, repealed or modified several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\u00a0\u00a0Certain key provisions of the Economic Growth Act and its implementing regulations include:\n\n\u2022eliminating supervisory stress testing and company run stress testing for bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets;\n\n\u2022prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate exposures unless they are for acquisition, development, or construction;\n\n\u2022exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000; and\n\n\u2022requiring the CFPB to provide guidance on how the Truth in Lending Act-Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure applies to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well as the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes.\n\nThe CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide national emergency economic relief measures. Many of the CARES Act\u2019s programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions, such as Old National and Old National Bank, and have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over Old National and Old National Bank. Furthermore, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation, lifecycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. In addition, it is possible that Congress will enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act and other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program. Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Old National has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. It is anticipated that additional revisions to the SBA\u2019s interim final rules on forgiveness and loan review procedures will be forthcoming to address these and related changes. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the \u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act\u201d that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the \u201cHHSB Act\u201d). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. In addition to extending and amending the PPP, the HHSB Act also creates a new grant program for \u201cshuttered venue operators.\u201d As a participating lender in the PPP, Old National Bank continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.\n\nGuidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19.  On March 22, 2020, a statement was issued by our banking regulators and titled the \u201cInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\u201d (the \u201cInteragency Statement\u201d) that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act terminates. Section 541 of the CAA extends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators\u2019 views on consumer protection considerations. In accordance with such guidance, Old National Bank is offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term (180 days or less) modifications in the form of payment\n\n9\n\n---\n\ndeferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on non-TDR loan modifications.\n\nMain Street Lending Program. The CARES Act encouraged the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to establish or implement various programs to help midsize businesses, nonprofits, and municipalities. On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve proposed the creation of the Main Street Lending Program to implement certain of these recommendations. Old National Bank continues to monitor developments related to the Main Street Lending Program.\n\nTemporary Regulatory Capital Relief Related to Impact of CECL. Concurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, in March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL\u2019s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology\u2019s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.\n\nThe Volcker Rule.\u00a0\u00a0Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d) contains provisions prohibiting bank, bank holding companies and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in private equity hedge funds and other \u201ccovered funds,\u201d except as otherwise permitted by the Volcker Rule. Rules implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted in December 2013 and the Volcker Rule went into effect on April 1, 2014. Proprietary trading is defined as the trading of securities, derivatives, or futures (or options on any of the foregoing) as principal, where such trading is principally for the purpose of short-term resale, benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements and realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The rule\u2019s definition of proprietary trading specifically excludes, among other things, market-making-related activity, certain government issued securities trading and certain risk management activities.\u00a0\u00a0Old National and Old National Bank do not engage in any prohibited proprietary trading activities.\u00a0\u00a0During 2019, the federal financial agencies announced revisions to the Volcker Rule that will simplify and streamline compliance requirements for Old National Bank.\n\nBank Holding Company Regulation.\u00a0\u00a0Old National is registered as a bank holding company and has elected to be a financial holding company.\u00a0\u00a0It is subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks.\u00a0\u00a0It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that, pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity.\u00a0\u00a0Under this requirement, Old National is expected to commit resources to support Old National Bank, including at times when Old National may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\n\nThe BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before a bank holding company can acquire more than a 5% voting interest of any bank or bank holding company.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, the BHC Act restricts Old National\u2019s non-banking activities to those which are determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto, as well as those that are permissible for a financial holding company.\n\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become \u201cundercapitalized\u201d (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve\u2019s risk-based capital guidelines.\u00a0\u00a0The FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision, including Old National Bank, are subject.\u00a0\u00a0The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations.\u00a0\u00a0Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk-weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank exceeded all risk-based\n\n10\n\n---\n\nminimum capital requirements of the FDIC and OCC as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\u00a0\u00a0For Old National\u2019s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe federal regulatory authorities\u2019 current risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \u201cBasel Committee\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The Basel Committee is a committee of international central banks and bank regulators responsible for establishing international supervisory guidelines for use in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation and promote financial stability on a global scale.\u00a0\u00a0In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee published the final revisions to the international regulatory capital framework generally referred to as \u201cBasel III,\u201d as a response to deficiencies in the international regulatory standards identified during the global financial crisis.\n\nEffective July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC approved final rules known as the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules,\u201d substantially revising the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including Old National and Old National Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\u00a0\u00a0The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies\u2019 rules. Certain of the Basel III Capital Rules came into effect for Old National and Old National Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period ending on December 31, 2018.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules introduced a new capital measure referred to as \u201cCommon Equity Tier 1\u201d (\u201cCET1\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The rules specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and \u201cAdditional Tier 1 capital\u201d instruments meeting specified requirements.\u00a0\u00a0CET1 capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the final rules, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and common equity Tier 1 minority interest.\u00a0\u00a0The rules also define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1, and not to the other components of capital.\u00a0\u00a0They also expand the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations.\n\nAs of January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require banking organizations to maintain:\n\n\u2022a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%);\n\n\u2022a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%);\n\n\u2022a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and\n\n\u2022a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Beginning in 2020, this framework for regulatory capital deductions to CET1 was simplified by increasing the deduction threshold to 25% at the individual level for each of the aforementioned categories.\u00a0\u00a0Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, Old National and Old National Bank are given a one-time election (the \u201cOpt-out Election\u201d) to filter certain AOCI components, comparable to the treatment under the current general risk-based capital rule. The Company chose the Opt-out Election on the March 31, 2015 Call Report and FR Y-9C for Old National Bank and Old National, respectively.\n\n11\n\n---\n\nImplementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and have been phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019).\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a \u201ccountercyclical capital buffer\u201d that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to Old National or Old National Bank.\n\nIn addition, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity.\u00a0\u00a0They establish a new framework under which mortgage-backed securities and other securitization exposures will be subject to risk-weights ranging from 20% to 1,250%.\u00a0\u00a0The rules also establish adjusted risk-weights for credit exposures, including multi-family and commercial real estate exposures that are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual, which will be subject to a 150% risk-weight, except in situations where qualifying collateral and/or guarantees are in place. The existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a 50% risk-weight (for prudently underwritten owner-occupied first liens that are current or less than 90 days past due) or a 100% risk-weight (for all other residential mortgage exposures including 90 days or more past due exposures).\n\nManagement believes that, as of December 31, 2020, Old National and Old National Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis. Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net income.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also permit banks with less than $250 billion in assets to choose to continue excluding unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital.\u00a0\u00a0As previously reported, Old National chose the Opt-out Election in its March 31, 2015 Call Report.\n\nThe liquidity framework under the Basel III Capital Rules (the \u201cBasel III liquidity framework\u201d) applies a balance sheet perspective to establish quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs. One test to address short-term liquidity risk is referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), designed to calculate the ratio of a banking entity\u2019s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cashflows over a 30-day time horizon. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term asset funding by incenting banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt, as well as increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The Basel III liquidity framework was implemented as a minimum standard on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period ending January 1, 2019.\u00a0\u00a0However, the federal banking agencies have not proposed rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and have not determined to what extent it will apply to U.S. banks that are not large, internationally active banks.\n\nManagement believes that, as of December 31, 2020, Old National Bank would meet the LCR requirement under the Basel III liquidity framework on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. Management\u2019s evaluation of the impact of the NSFR requirement is ongoing as of December 31, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Requirements to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net income.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations.\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the \u201cFDIA\u201d) requires, among other things, federal bank regulatory authorities to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Under current prompt corrective action regulations, a bank will be (i) \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not \u201cwell capitalized\u201d; (iii) \u201cundercapitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d if the institution\u2019s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets.\u00a0\u00a0An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters.\u00a0\u00a0A bank\u2019s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank\u2019s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\n\n12\n\n---\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules revised the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by:\n\n\u2022introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status;\n\n\u2022increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the previous 6.0%); and\n\n\u2022eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized.\n\nThe FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUndercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution\u2019s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution\u2019s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan.\u00a0\u00a0The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance.\u00a0\u00a0The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution\u2019s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan.\u00a0\u00a0If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cSignificantly undercapitalized\u201d depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.\n\nManagement believes that, as of December 31, 2020, Old National Bank was \u201cwell capitalized\u201d based on the existing ratios and the ratios as modified by the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nDeposit Insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Substantially all of the deposits of Old National Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC and Old National Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Under the FDIC\u2019s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions with at least $10 billion in assets, such as Old National Bank, are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institution\u2019s regulatory ratings and certain financial measures.\u00a0\u00a0The scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate.\n\nThe performance score measures an institution\u2019s financial performance and its ability to withstand stress.\u00a0\u00a0The loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution\u2019s failure.\u00a0\u00a0Once the performance and loss severity scores are calculated, these scores will be converted to a total score.\u00a0\u00a0An institution with a total score of 30 or less will pay the minimum base assessment rate, and an institution with a total score of 90 or more will pay the maximum initial base assessment rate.\u00a0\u00a0For total scores between 30 and 90, initial base assessment rates will rise at an increasing rate as the total score increases.\u00a0\u00a0The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments.\n\nUnder the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\n\nSafety and Soundness Regulations.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the FDIA, the federal banking agencies adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify, monitor, and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies authorize the\n\n13\n\n---\n\nagencies to require that an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing corrective actions and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d provisions of FDIA. If the institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\n\nIncentive Compensation.\u00a0\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as Old National and Old National Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which Old National may structure compensation for its executives.\n\nIn June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed above.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Old National, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.\n\nEnforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\nLoans to One Borrower.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2020, Old National Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.\n\nDepositor Preference.\u00a0\u00a0The FDIA provides that, in the event of the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\u00a0\u00a0The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings that must be publicly disclosed. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to\n\n14\n\n---\n\nacquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of certain applications.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank received a rating of \u201csatisfactory\u201d in its latest CRA examination.\n\nFair Lending Laws.\u00a0\u00a0Fair Lending laws prohibit discrimination in banking services and include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d) and the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, or other prohibited factors in the extension of credit and residential real estate transactions. In May 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and KleinBank entered into a public Settlement Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) regarding alleged violations of the FHA and the ECOA within the Minneapolis, Minnesota market. Old National Bank, as the legal successor in interest to KleinBank, has assumed the ongoing terms and obligations of the Agreement.\n\nFinancial Privacy.\u00a0\u00a0The federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.\n\nOld National Bank is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These guidelines describe the federal banking agencies\u2019 expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nThe anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) rules codify within the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the \u201cFinCEN\u201d) regulations the \u201cpillars\u201d that must be included in a financial institution\u2019s AML compliance program. Regulators have communicated their expectations with respect to five pillars: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; (2) the designation of a compliance officer; (3) the establishment of an ongoing AML employee training program; (4) the implementation of an independent audit function to test AML programs; and (5) appropriate risk based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including substantial monetary penalties, extensive and expensive remedial requirements, and causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including substantial monetary penalties, extensive and expensive remedial requirements, and causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates.\u00a0\u00a0Transactions between Old National Bank and its affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations. These regulations limit the types and amounts of covered transactions that may be engaged in by Old National Bank and its affiliates and generally require those transactions to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis. The term \u201caffiliate\u201d is defined to mean any company that controls or is under common control with Old National Bank and includes Old National and its non-bank subsidiaries. \u201cCovered transactions\u201d include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities\n\n15\n\n---\n\nissued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, these regulations require that any such transaction by Old National Bank (or its subsidiaries) with an affiliate, if permitted, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis.\n\nFederal law also limits Old National Bank\u2019s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% or more shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to such insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Old National Bank\u2019s capital.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank System.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLBI, Old National Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the FHLBI in an amount at least equal to the sum of the membership stock purchase requirement, determined on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year, and the activity-based stock purchase requirement, determined on a daily basis. For Old National Bank, the membership stock purchase requirement is 1.0% of the Mortgage-Related Assets, as defined by the FHLBI, which consists principally of residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, held by Old National Bank.\u00a0\u00a0The activity-based stock purchase requirement is equal to the sum of: (1) a specified percentage ranging from 2.0% to 5.0%, which for Old National Bank is 5.0%, of outstanding borrowings from the FHLBI; (2) a specified percentage ranging from 0.0% to 5.0%, which for Old National Bank is 3.0%, of the outstanding principal balance of Acquired Member Assets, as defined by the FHLBI, and delivery commitments for Acquired Member Assets; (3) a specified dollar amount related to certain off-balance sheet items, which for Old National Bank is inapplicable; and (4) a specified percentage ranging from 0.0% to 5.0% of the carrying value on the FHLBI\u2019s balance sheet of derivative contracts between the FHLBI and Old National Bank, which for Old National Bank is inapplicable. The FHLBI can adjust the specified percentages and dollar amount from time to time within the ranges established by the FHLBI capital plan. As of December 31, 2020, Old National Bank was in compliance with the minimum stock ownership requirement.\n\nFederal Reserve System.\u00a0\u00a0Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0%. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. Prior to the change effective March 26, 2020, a reserve of 3% was to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $12.4 million and $79.5 million (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $79.5 million. The first $12.4 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) was exempt from the reserve requirements.\n\nOther Regulations.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to, the:\n\n\u2022Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n\n\u2022Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans;\n\n\u2022Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information;\n\n\u2022Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;\n\n\u2022Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;\n\n\u2022Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;\n\n\u2022Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and\n\n\u2022Electronic Funds Transfer Act, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers\u2019 rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services.\n\n16\n\n---\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also significantly impacts the various consumer protection laws, rules and regulations applicable to financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0The statute rolls back the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that was enjoyed by national banks by (1) requiring that a state consumer financial law prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of a national bank\u2019s powers before it can be preempted, (2) mandating that any preemption decision be made on a case by case basis rather than a blanket rule, and (3) ending the applicability of preemption to subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, we may now be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business, and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in each state.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, including Old National Bank, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Old National\u2019s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.\n\nThe rules issued by the CFPB have impacted our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will likely continue to increase our overall regulatory compliance costs.\n\nDividend Limitation.\u00a0\u00a0Old National Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act, is supervised, regulated and examined by the OCC, and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.\u00a0\u00a0A substantial portion of Old National\u2019s cash revenue is derived from dividends paid to it by Old National Bank.\u00a0\u00a0These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions as summarized in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of Old National in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Old National cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of Old National. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Old National or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on Old National\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nAll reports filed electronically by Old National with the SEC, including the annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements, other information and amendments to those reports filed or furnished (as applicable), are accessible at no cost on Old National\u2019s web site at www.oldnational.com as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically submitting such materials to the SEC.\u00a0\u00a0The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, and Old National\u2019s filings are accessible on the SEC\u2019s web site at www.sec.gov."
