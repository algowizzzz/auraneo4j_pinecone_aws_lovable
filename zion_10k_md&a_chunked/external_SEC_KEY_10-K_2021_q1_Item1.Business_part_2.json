    "text": " issued interagency examiner guidance outlining supervisory principles for assessing the safety and soundness of banks given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The agencies stated that they will consider the unique, evolving, and potentially long-term nature of the issues that banks are confronting and will exercise appropriate flexibility in their supervisory response. The agencies said that they will continue to assess institutions in accordance with existing agency policies and procedures and will consider whether a bank\u2019s management has managed risk appropriately, including taking appropriate actions in response to stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d), enacted on December 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. Among other things, the CAA extends the provision in the CARES Act that allows financial institutions to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs through the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. The CAA also provides additional funding for SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses under the PPP (discussed above) and makes a number of changes to this program, including the expansion of the pool of eligible borrowers and the addition of certain categories of expenses that will be eligible for forgiveness. KeyBank participates in the PPP as a lender.\n\n25\n\n---"
