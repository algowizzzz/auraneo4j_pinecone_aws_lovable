We had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2022.\n\nWe conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For further information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d on page 38 in Management's Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe focus on serving our customers and communities. Our experienced bankers develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nSome of the products and services we provide include:\n\n\u2022Commercial and small business banking.

Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, and financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d). Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens.\n\nOur key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, mobile and online banking functionality and other delivery methods, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationship with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nThe banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. In some cases, these regulations may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.\n\nThe National Bank Act\n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act, but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.\n\nThe National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.\n\nCapital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2022, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules\n\n6\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\ndefine the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d), and in excess of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, compared with our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2022.\n\nSchedule 1\n\nMINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |\n|  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | |\n| CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 9.8 | | % |\n| Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.5 | |  |\n| Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.2 | |  |\n| Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 7.7 | |  |\n\nFinancial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nWe utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test. Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require many banks to adhere to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) process and stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). We are not regulated by the FRB and therefore are not subject to this process. However, we use the FRB\u2019s CCAR process, including published economic scenarios, to inform our stress testing activities.\n\nLiquidity\n\nWe manage liquidity in accordance with Basel III liquidity requirements, and we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. During the recent pandemic, our liquidity profile benefited from a significant influx of deposits, which was impacted by certain fiscal and monetary policy decisions. In 2022, with the withdrawal of such measures by the federal government, our deposit levels decreased; however, our liquidity profile remained above regulatory and internal Bank limits. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the rising interest rate environment.\n\n7\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nFinancial Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\nThe federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\n\nState regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. During the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators. For example, in 2022, the SEC proposed new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies. If the proposed rules are adopted, they may require changes in the way such companies disclose material cybersecurity events. These evolving laws and rules will continue to have an impact on our risk management practices.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.\n\nUnder the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.\n\nAn institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.\n\n8\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nOther Regulations\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.\n\n\u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See discussion under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.\n\n\u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions.\n\n\u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.\n\n\u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.\n\n\u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).\n\n\u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.\n\n\u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.\n\n\u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.\n\n\u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n\u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.\n\nWe are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.\n\n9\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by ESG interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to ESG issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, our ongoing monitoring enables us to enhance our business practices by incorporating ESG recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities. In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s 2022 proposed rule on climate-related disclosures, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address ESG issues. These laws may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations and may increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address ESG issues. The report is available on our website.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices. This system includes frameworks, policies, and guidelines such as the following:\n\n\u2022Corporate Governance Guidelines;\n\n\u2022A Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees;\n\n\u2022A Director's Code of Conduct;\n\n\u2022A Risk Management Framework;\n\n\u2022A Related Party Transaction Policy;\n\n\u2022A Compensation Clawback Policy;\n\n\u2022Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines;\n\n\u2022An Insider Trading Policy, including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders; and\n\n\u2022Charters for our Executive, Audit, Risk Oversight, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.\n\nMore information on our corporate governance practices is available on our website at zionsbancorporation.com. Our website is not part of this Form 10-K.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWe are proud of our employees who bring their unique, diverse talents to work each day. We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.\n\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on how and where we work. We were successful in transitioning most of our employees to working remotely, and as the pandemic subsided and related treatments improved, we returned to more in-person collaboration while supporting certain flexible and remote work arrangements. We believe that in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture.\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more options with health care plans, and greater access to mental health benefits.\n\nWe had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees December\u00a031, 2022. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our employees.\n\n10\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nSchedule 2\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | |\n| Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Management | | | 52% | | |  | | | 28% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n| Non-management | | | 61% | | |  | | | 39% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n| Overall | | | 59% | | |  | | | 37% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | |\n\nThe following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:\n\nCultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate\n\nWe believe in an environment where people are respected and valued, and where individual and cultural differences are embraced. We also believe that our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees.\n\nWe use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.\n\nWe have instituted enterprise-wide and affiliate diversity, equity, and inclusion councils; employee business forums; regional inclusion champions; mental health initiatives; and a broad range of employee and community events. Throughout the organization, employee business resource groups foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through forum meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity, both internally and externally.\n\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success\n\nWe are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.\n\nWe offer more than 2,000 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2022, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded and successful employees.\n\nWe are also mindful of the increasing competition for talent in the labor market. We experienced greater challenges in the recent past in filling certain job openings relative to when labor market conditions were more balanced, but we began to see improvement in 2022. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.\n\nRecognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees\n\nOur comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside\n\n11\n\n---\n\n[Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)\n\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nopportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.\n\nWe routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.\n\nOur employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\n\nWe value work-life balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental, physical, social, and financial wellness. Some of our key benefits include the following:\n\n\u2022Corporate match for our 401(k) plan of 4.5% of an employee\u2019s salary and incentive compensation;\n\n\u2022Annual profit-sharing contributions;\n\n\u2022Health care plan options including behavioral health, wellness, and autism spectrum disorder services;\n\n\u2022Expanded mental health coverage, including coaching and clinical therapy sessions;\n\n\u2022Preventive prescription drug coverage not subject to deductibles;\n\n\u2022Paid parental leave program;\n\n\u2022Adoption assistance program; and\n\n\u2022Paid time off for various community service activities and other volunteer opportunities."
