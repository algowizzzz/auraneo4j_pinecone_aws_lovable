            "text": "General  Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.\u00ae, a Texas corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), was formed in 1983 as a vehicle to acquire the former Allied Bank in Edna, Texas, which was chartered in 1949 as The First National Bank of Edna and is now known as Prosperity Bank. The Company is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank\u00ae (\u201cProsperity Bank\u00ae\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d). The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to businesses and consumers throughout Texas and Oklahoma.

The Company\u2019s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas and its telephone number is (281) 269-7199. The Company\u2019s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com.  The Company\u2019s market consists of the communities served by its banking centers. The diverse nature of the economies in each local market served by the Company provides the Company with a varied customer base and allows the Company to spread its lending risk throughout a number of different industries including professional service firms and their principals, manufacturing, tourism, recreation, petrochemicals, farming and ranching. The Company\u2019s market areas outside of Houston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Lubbock, Austin, Tulsa and Oklahoma City are dominated by either small community banks or branches of larger regional banks. Management believes that the Company, through its responsive customer service and community banking philosophy, combined with the sophistication of a larger regional bank holding company, has a competitive advantage in its market areas and excellent growth opportunities through acquisitions, new banking center locations and additional business development.  Operating under a community banking philosophy, the Company seeks to develop broad customer relationships based on service and convenience while maintaining its prudent approach to lending and sound asset quality. The Company has grown through a combination of internal growth, merger and acquisition transactions and the opening of new banking centers. As a result of its stable customer relationships, the Company is able to maintain a low cost of funds. Utilizing its stable customer relationships and employing stringent cost controls, the Company has been profitable in every year of its existence, including the periods of adverse economic conditions in Texas and Oklahoma.  In addition to internal growth, the Company has completed the following acquisitions since 2014 (through December 31, 2024):  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | Acquired Entity |  | Acquired Bank |  | Completion Date |  | Number of Banking Centers Acquired (1) | |  | | F&M Bancorporation Inc. |  | The F&M Bank & Trust Company |  | 2014 |  |  | 11 |  | | Tradition Bancshares, Inc. |  | Tradition Bank |  | 2016 |  |  | 7 |  | | LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. |  | LegacyTexas Bank |  | 2019 |  |  | 42 |  | | First Bancshares of Texas, Inc. |  | FirstCapital Bank of Texas |  | 2023 |  |  | 16 |  | | Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. |  | Lone Star State Bank of West Texas |  | 2024 |  |  | 5 |  |  \u00a0  (1)  The number of banking centers added does not include any locations of the acquired entity that were closed and consolidated with existing banking centers of the Company upon consummation of the transaction or closed after consummation of the transaction.  Recent Acquisitions  Merger of Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. \u2014 Effective April 1, 2024, the Company completed the merger of Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cLone Star\u201d) into the Company and the subsequent merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (\u201cLone Star Bank\u201d), into the Bank (collectively, the \u201cLSSB Merger\u201d). Lone Star operated five full-service banking offices in the West Texas area, including its main office in Lubbock, and one banking center in each of Brownfield, Midland, Odessa and Big Spring, Texas. As of March 31, 2024, Lone Star, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $1.38 billion, total loans of $1.07 billion and total deposits of $1.24 billion.  Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, the Company issued 2,376,182 shares of its common stock plus approximately $64.1 million in cash for all outstanding shares of Lone Star. This resulted in goodwill of $106.7 million as of December 31, 2024, which does not include all the subsequent fair value adjustments that have not yet been finalized. Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price paid over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of the fair value of liabilities assumed. Additionally, the Company recognized $17.7 million of core deposit intangibles as of December 31, 2024. In October 2024, the Company completed the operational conversion of Lone Star Bank.  1  ---  Merger of First Bancshares of Texas, Inc. \u2014 Effective May 1, 2023, the Company completed the merger of First Bancshares of Texas, Inc.

At December 31, 2024, the Bank maintained approximately 816,300 separate deposit accounts including certificates of deposit and 70,400 separate loan accounts. At December 31, 2024, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were 34.5% of the Bank\u2019s total deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s average cost of funds was 1.87%, and the Company\u2019s average cost of deposits (excluding all borrowings) was 1.47%.  The Company has been an active real estate lender, with commercial real estate (including farmland and multi-family residential); 1-4 family residential (including home equity); and construction, land development and other land loans comprising 29.3%, 38.3% and 12.9%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December 31, 2024. The Company is active in commercial and industrial lending, with commercial loans comprising 11.3% of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December 31, 2024. The Company also offers agricultural loans, loans for automobiles and other consumer durables, home equity loans, debit and credit cards, digital banking solutions, trust and wealth management, retail brokerage services, mortgage services and treasury management.

By offering certificates of deposit, interest checking accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts at competitive rates, the Company gives its depositors a full range of traditional deposit products.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s trust department maintained total assets of $2.89 billion, including managed assets of $2.35 billion. The trust department provides trust services in the Company\u2019s various market areas.  The Company\u2019s banking operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. For more information about the Company\u2019s segment reporting, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  3  ---  Business Strategies  The Company\u2019s main objective is to increase deposits and loans through internal growth, as well as through acquisition opportunities, while maintaining efficiency, providing individualized customer service and maximizing profitability. To achieve this objective, the Company has employed the following strategic goals:  Continue Community Banking Emphasis. Although the Company has significantly grown in the last several years, it intends to continue operating as a community banking organization focused on meeting the specific needs of consumers and businesses in its market areas. The Company provides a high degree of responsiveness combined with a wide variety of banking products and services. The Company staffs its banking centers with experienced bankers who possess lending expertise to effectively serve their community and gives them authority with centralized support to make certain pricing and credit decisions, avoiding the bureaucratic structure of larger banks. Each banking center has its own listed local business telephone number. Customers are served by a local banker with decision making authority. The Company also maintains specialty commercial lending lines of business staffed by bankers with lending expertise in the various business lines\u2014commercial middle market, energy, mortgage warehouse and insurance lending.  Expand Market Share Through Internal Growth and a Disciplined Acquisition Strategy. The Company intends to continue seeking opportunities, both inside and outside its existing markets, to expand either by acquiring existing banks or branches of banks or by establishing new banking centers. All of the Company\u2019s acquisitions have been accretive to earnings within 12 months after acquisition date and generally have supplied the Company with relatively low-cost deposits which have been used to fund the Company\u2019s lending and investing activities. However, future acquisitions, if any, may not be accretive to earnings within any particular time period. Factors used by the Company to evaluate expansion opportunities include (1) the similarity in management and operating philosophies, (2) whether the acquisition will be accretive to earnings and enhance shareholder value, (3) whether the acquisition will strategically expand the Company\u2019s geographic footprint and (4) the opportunity to enhance the Company\u2019s market presence in existing market areas.  Increase Loan Volume and Diversify Loan Portfolio. While maintaining its prudent approach to lending, the Company has emphasized both new and existing loan products, focusing on increasing its commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loan portfolios. Loans at December 31, 2024 were $22.15 billion compared with $21.18 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $968.7 million or 4.6%. Commercial and industrial loans were $2.51 billion and represented 11.3% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Commercial real estate loans (including multifamily residential and excluding farmland) were $5.80 billion and represented 26.2% of the total portfolio as of December 31, 2024. One-to-four-family residential loans (excluding home equity) were $7.58 billion and represented 34.2% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Construction, land development and other land loans were $2.86 billion and represented 12.9% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Warehouse Purchase Program loans were $1.08 billion and represented 4.9% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024.  Maintain Sound Asset Quality. The Company continues to maintain the sound asset quality that has been representative of its historical loan portfolio. As the Company continues to diversify and increase its lending activities and acquire loans in acquisitions, it may face higher risks of nonpayment and increased risks in the event of prolonged economic downturns. The Company intends to continue to employ the strict underwriting guidelines and comprehensive loan review processes that have contributed to its low incidence of nonperforming assets and minimal charge-offs in relation to its size. Nonperforming assets were 0.37% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2024. Excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, nonperforming assets were 0.39% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2024. All Warehouse Purchase Program loans were performing loans at December 31, 2024.  Continue Focus on Efficiency. The Company plans to maintain its stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has invested significantly in the infrastructure required to centralize many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan and deposit processing. For its banking centers, which the Company operates as independent profit centers, the Company supplies complete support in the areas of loan review, appraisals, loan and deposit processing, internal audit, compliance and training. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate additional growth while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through economies of scale.  Enhance Cross-Selling. The Company uses incentives and friendly competition to encourage cross-selling efforts and increase cross-selling results among its associates. Officers and associates have access to each customer\u2019s existing and related account relationships and are better able to inform customers of additional products when customers visit or call the various banking centers or use their drive-in facilities. In addition, the Company includes product information on its web page and in monthly statements and other mailings.  4  ---  Competition  The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of the Company depends principally on its ability to compete in its market areas. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based nonbank lenders, financial technology companies and certain other nonfinancial entities, including retail stores that may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations that may offer more favorable financing than the Company. Continued consolidation and rapid technological changes within the financial services industry will likely change the nature and intensity of competition, but should also create opportunities for the Company to demonstrate and leverage its competitive advantages. The Company believes it has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service, technology and responsive decision-making with respect to loans, by establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty and by providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers.  Supervision and Regulation  The Company is extensively regulated under federal and state law. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank, are difficult to predict. Regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters, and similar written guidance applicable to the Company or to the Bank. The Company expects the Trump administration will seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the Biden administration, impacting the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities of the federal banking agencies. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s business, operations, and earnings.  The Company and the Bank must undergo regular examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential.  The supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of the bank holding company\u2019s shareholders or creditors. The banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations.  The following description summarizes some of the laws to which the Company and the Bank are subject. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.  The Company  The Company is a financial holding company pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHCA\u201d). Accordingly, the Company is subject to primary supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d). The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the BHCA and other federal laws subject financial and bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Further, as a public company, the Company also files reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and is subject to its regulatory authority, including the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the Company\u2019s securities, financial reporting and certain governance matters. Because the Company\u2019s securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cPB,\u201d the Company is subject to NYSE\u2019s rules for listed companies, including rules relating to corporate governance.  Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends and Share Repurchases. The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company\u2019s revenues is dividends received from the Bank. As described in more detail below, federal and state law places limitations on the amount that banks may pay in dividends, which the Bank must adhere to when paying dividends to the Company. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected capital needs and financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company\u2019s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to limit or prohibit the payment of dividends  5  ---  if, in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of a bank holding company\u2019s financial condition. Federal Reserve Board policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure.  The Federal Reserve Board generally requires prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of a bank holding company\u2019s own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the net consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company\u2019s consolidated net worth. Further, the Federal Reserve Board may oppose a dividend or repurchase transaction if it would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation.  In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d) was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements.  Source of Strength. Federal Reserve Board policy and federal law require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including support at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. The FDIC may require reports from the Company to assess the Company\u2019s ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring the Company to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of the Bank\u2019s financial distress.  If the Company were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment.  Scope of Permissible Activities. As a financial holding company, the Company is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or, if determined by the Federal Reserve Board, complementary to financial activities. If the Bank ceases to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed\u201d under applicable regulatory standards, or if the Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d), the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require the Company to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.  Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees, and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve Board, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by the Company if they determine that the Company has insufficient capital or other resources, or is otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority,  6  ---  the Company\u2019s regulators can require the Company or its subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, confidential agreements, and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.  If the Company is unable to comply with the terms of any then applicable regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements or orders, then the Company could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and preferred stock, if any. If such supervisory actions were to occur, the Company could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on the Company\u2019s existing business, and the Company could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such action could have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of the Company\u2019s securities.  The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be in excess of $1.0 million for each day the activity continues.  Anti-Tying Restrictions. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (1) the client obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries or (2) the client not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a client obtains two or more traditional bank products. The law also expressly permits banks to engage in other forms of tying and authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to grant additional exceptions by regulation or order.  Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHCA permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that the Company and any other bank holding company, whether located in Texas or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHCA requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (2) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (3) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve Board is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the company in combating money laundering.  \u00a0  Control Acquisitions. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, or before acquiring control of any FDIC-insured bank, such as the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the Federal Reserve Board may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of the Company\u2019s stock.  The Volcker Rule. Section 13 of the BHCA, commonly referred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d generally prohibits the Company and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries from (1) engaging in certain proprietary trading, and (2) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a \u201ccovered fund,\u201d all subject to certain exceptions. Since neither the Company nor the Bank engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on the operations of the Company or the Bank.  7  ---  Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as the Company and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2024, these rules have not been implemented.  In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or \u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The NYSE\u2019s listing standards pursuant to the SEC\u2019s rule became effective on October 2, 2023. The Company adopted a compensation recovery policy pursuant to the NYSE listing standards on November 13, 2023.  Capital Requirements  The Company and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the banking regulators may determine that a banking organization based on its size, complexity, or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution\u2019s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution\u2019s ability to manage those risks, are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution\u2019s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on the Company\u2019s capital levels.  The Company and the Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock plus retained earnings less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets, and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain \u201chigh volatility\u201d commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities, and equity holdings.  The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.  In addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules required a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks, or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d, \u201cundercapitalized\u201d, \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d, and \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d. A depository institution\u2019s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management, and capital distributions depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations, and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution's  8  ---  assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution\u2019s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.  To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:  \u2022  6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;  \u2022  8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;  \u2022  10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and  \u2022  5.0% leverage ratio.  The Federal Reserve Board has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules applicable to banks. For purposes of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. Also, the Federal Reserve Board may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company\u2019s particular condition, risk profile, and growth plans.  Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.  In 2024, the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the capital conservation buffer. As of December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 16.42%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 16.42%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 17.67% and Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (leverage ratio) was 10.82%.  In response to the novel strain of coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic, in March 2020 the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allowed banking organizations that implemented ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2013 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d (\u201cCECL\u201d) in 2020 to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years. This two-year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available. The Company adopted the option provided by the interim final rule, which delayed the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital through 2021, after which the effects were phased in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period include both the initial impact of the Company\u2019s adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021. The cumulative amount of the transition adjustments was phased in over a three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2022, was 75% recognized in 2022, 50% recognized in 2023, and 25% recognized in 2024.  The Bank  The Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the DIF of the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Such supervision and regulation subject the Bank to special restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Because the Federal Reserve Board regulates the Company, the Federal Reserve Board also has supervisory authority which affects the Bank. Further, because the Bank has total assets of over $10 billion, the Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). The CFPB regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under the federal consumer financial laws.  Equivalence to National Bank Powers. The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, FDICIA has operated to limit this authority. FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as principal in any activity not  9  ---  permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the DIF. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.  Standards for Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.  Branching. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are permitted to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state, subject to applicable regulatory review and approval requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also modified certain regulatory requirements for interstate mergers and acquisitions, including that the acquiring bank must be well capitalized and well managed. Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas or any other state, subject to federal law requirements, provided that the branch is approved in advance by the Texas Department of Banking. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers.  Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm\u2019s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders and their related interests.  Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of the Company\u2019s operating funds, and it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to the Company will continue to be the Company\u2019s principal source of operating funds. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank will be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d The FDIC may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. The Bank is also subject to limitations on the payment of dividends under Texas law. Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as the Company) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.  Consumer Financial Protection. The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal bank regulators, the CFPB, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights and civil money penalties in each jurisdiction in which the Bank operates. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in the Bank\u2019s failure to obtain any required regulatory approval for merger or other acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.  10  ---  The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater and other providers of consumer financial products or services such as the Bank. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of federal consumer financial laws, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate federal consumer financial laws and may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial laws in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction.  In October 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule that requires a provider of payment accounts or products, such as a bank, to make data available to consumers free upon request regarding the products or services they obtain from the provider. Any such data provider is also required to make such data available to third parties, with the consumer\u2019s express authorization and through an interface that satisfies formatting, performance and security standards, for the purpose of such third parties providing the consumer with financial products or services requested by the consumer. Data is required to be made available under the rule includes transaction information, account balance, account and routing numbers, terms and conditions, upcoming bill information, and certain account verification data. The final rule is intended to give consumers control over their financial data, including with whom it is shared, and encourage competition in the provision of consumer financial products or services. Banks with over $10 billion and less than $250 billion in total assets, such as the Bank, must comply with the new requirements by April 1, 2027.  In December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule that, among other things, amends Regulation Z (otherwise known as the \u201cTruth In Lending Act\u201d) and impacts extensions of overdraft credit offered by financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. The final rule defines overdraft credit as generally including consumer credit extended by a financial institution to pay a transaction from a checking or other transaction account (other than a prepaid account) held at the financial institution when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in that account. The final rule requires that extensions of overdraft credit adhere to consumer protections required of similarly situated products, unless the overdraft fee is at or below the institution's costs and losses as determined by (1) calculating its own costs and losses using a standard set forth in the rule; or (2) relying on a benchmark flat fee of five dollars. An overdraft that incurs charges that exceed costs and losses will become a covered overdraft credit and subject to Regulation Z which requires that lenders disclose borrowing costs, interest rates and fees upfront and in clear language so consumers can understand all the terms and make informed decisions. Furthermore, covered overdraft credit extensions must be put in a credit account and may not be structured as a negative balance on a checking or other transaction account. The provisions of the final rule become effective on October 1, 2025.  Customer Information Security. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, nonpublic customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bank has adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements.  \u00a0  Deposit Insurance Assessments. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF, and the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. A depository institution\u2019s DIF assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by the assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the depository institution. The initial base assessment rate is based on its capital level and CAMELS ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and, in some cases, additional discretionary adjustments by the FDIC to reflect additional risk factors.  In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment is intended to increase the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline prescribed under the FDIC\u2019s amended restoration plan.  In November 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the DIF associated with several bank failures that occurred during early 2023. The assessment base for the special assessment was equal to estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion, to be collected at a quarterly rate of approximately 3.36 basis points for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Under the final rule, the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, and the FDIC has retained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis. The extent to which any additional future assessments will impact the Company\u2019s future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain.  11  ---  Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or \u201cswipe\u201d fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Bank and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer\u2019s debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer at least two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal under which the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction would be the sum of 14.4 cents per transaction and 4 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Furthermore, the fraud-prevention adjustment would increase from a maximum of 1 cent to 1.3 cents per debit card transaction. The proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap, which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered by the Federal Reserve Board from large debit card issuers. The extent to which any such proposed changes in permissible interchange fees will impact the Company\u2019s future revenue is uncertain.  Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.  Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d) and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank\u2019s CRA record when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (\u201cFIRREA\u201d) requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank\u2019s performance under the CRA. In the case of a financial holding company or a bank holding company, the CRA performance records of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction.  On October 24, 2023, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), Federal Reserve Board, and FDIC issued a final rule to modernize their respective CRA regulations. The revised rules substantially alter the methodology for assessing compliance with the CRA, with material aspects taking effect January 1, 2026, and revised data reporting requirements taking effect January 1, 2027. Among other things, the revised rules evaluate lending outside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile banking, apply a metrics-based benchmarking approach to assessment, and clarify eligible CRA activities. As of December 31, 2024, the revised CRA regulations have been subject to an injunction since March 29, 2024.  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d) require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent them from being used for, and to detect and deter, money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued, and in some cases proposed, a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. The regulations also impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution and could block or substantially delay a merger or other acquisition transaction.  12  ---  Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the \u201cOFAC\u201d rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on \u201cU.S. persons\u201d engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including substantial delay or blocking of a merger or other acquisition transaction.  Cybersecurity. The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If the Company fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, the Company could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.  Banking organizations are required to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States. In 2023, the SEC issued a final rule that requires disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Under this rule, banking organizations that are SEC registrants must generally disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of determining it is material, with periodic updates as to the status of the incident in subsequent filings as necessary.  State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs, and many states, including Texas, have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. The Company expects this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which its customers are located.  Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers.  Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives  From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Effect on Economic Environment  The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits; and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.  13  ---  Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted.",

            "text": "General  Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.\u00ae, a Texas corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), was formed in 1983 as a vehicle to acquire the former Allied Bank in Edna, Texas, which was chartered in 1949 as The First National Bank of Edna and is now known as Prosperity Bank. The Company is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank\u00ae (\u201cProsperity Bank\u00ae\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d). The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to businesses and consumers throughout Texas and Oklahoma. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank operated 273 full service banking locations: 65 in the Houston area, including The Woodlands; 30 in the South Texas area, including Corpus Christi and Victoria; 63 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; 22 in the East Texas area; 29 in the Central Texas area, including Austin and San Antonio; 34 in the West Texas area, including Lubbock, Midland-Odessa and Abilene; 16 in the Bryan/College Station area; 6 in the Central Oklahoma area and 8 in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. The Company\u2019s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas and its telephone number is (281)\u00a0269-7199. The Company\u2019s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com.  The Company\u2019s market consists of the communities served by its banking centers. The diverse nature of the economies in each local market served by the Company provides the Company with a varied customer base and allows the Company to spread its lending risk throughout a number of different industries including professional service firms and their principals, manufacturing, tourism, recreation, petrochemicals, farming and ranching. The Company\u2019s market areas outside of Houston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Lubbock, Austin, Tulsa and Oklahoma City are dominated by either small community banks or branches of larger regional banks. Management believes that the Company, through its responsive customer service and community banking philosophy, combined with the sophistication of a larger regional bank holding company, has a competitive advantage in its market areas and excellent growth opportunities through acquisitions, new banking center locations and additional business development.  Operating under a community banking philosophy, the Company seeks to develop broad customer relationships based on service and convenience while maintaining its prudent approach to lending and sound asset quality. The Company has grown through a combination of internal growth, merger and acquisition transactions and the opening of new banking centers. As a result of its stable customer relationships, the Company is able to maintain a low cost of funds. Utilizing that and employing stringent cost controls, the Company has been profitable in every year of its existence, including the periods of adverse economic conditions in Texas and Oklahoma.  In addition to internal growth, the Company completed the following acquisitions within the last ten years (through December\u00a031, 2021):  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Acquired Entity |  | Acquired Bank |  | Completion Date |  | Number of Banking\u00a0Centers Acquired\u00a0(1) | |  |  | | Texas Bankers, Inc. |  | Bank of Texas |  | 2012 |  |  | 2 |  |  | | The Bank Arlington |  | The Bank Arlington |  | 2012 |  |  | 1 |  |  | | American State Financial Corporation |  | American State Bank |  | 2012 |  |  | 37 |  |  | | Community National Bank |  | Community National Bank |  | 2012 |  |  | 1 |  |  | | East Texas Financial Services, Inc. |  | Firstbank |  | 2013 |  |  | 4 |  |  | | Coppermark Bancshares, Inc. |  | Coppermark Bank |  | 2013 |  |  | 6 |  |  | | FVNB Corp. |  | First Victoria National Bank |  | 2013 |  |  | 20 |  |  | | F&M Bancorporation Inc. |  | The F&M Bank & Trust Company |  | 2014 |  |  | 11 |  |  | | Tradition Bancshares, Inc. |  | Tradition Bank |  | 2016 |  |  | 7 |  |  | | LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. |  | LegacyTexas Bank |  | 2019 |  |  | 42 |  |  |  (1) The number of banking centers added does not include any locations of the acquired entity that were closed and consolidated with existing banking centers of the Company upon consummation of the transaction or closed after consummation of the transaction.  1  ---  Acquisition  Merger with LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc.\u2014On November 1, 2019, LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. (\u201cLegacyTexas\u201d), merged into the Company and LegacyTexas Bank merged into the Bank (collectively, the \u201cMerger\u201d).

Since the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) in 2020, the Company has obtained Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) approvals on approximately 18,700 loans totaling $2.036 billion and, as of December 31, 2021, had an outstanding balance of 1,512 loans totaling $169.9 million.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company provided relief to its loan customers through loan extensions and deferrals beginning in March 2020 to selected borrowers on a case-by-case basis. The Company\u2019s troubled debt restructurings do not include loan modifications related to COVID-19.

Banking Activities  The Company, through the Bank, offers a variety of traditional loan and deposit products to its customers, which consist primarily of consumers and businesses throughout Texas and Oklahoma. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank maintained approximately 785,000 separate deposit accounts including certificates of deposit and 68,000 separate loan accounts. At December\u00a031, 2021, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were 34.9% of the Bank\u2019s total deposits. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s average cost of funds was 0.18% and the Company\u2019s average cost of deposits (excluding all borrowings) was 0.18%.  3  ---  The Company has been an active real estate lender, with commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential), 1-4 family residential (including home equity) and construction, land development and other land loans comprising\u00a030.6%, 30.4% and 12.4%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December\u00a031, 2021. The Company is active in commercial and industrial lending, with commercial loans comprising 14.6% of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December\u00a031, 2021. The Company also offers agricultural loans, loans for automobiles and other consumer durables, home equity loans, debit and credit cards, digital banking solutions, trust and wealth management, retail brokerage services, mortgage services and treasury management. The Company offers businesses a broad array of loan products including term loans, lines of credit and loans for working capital, business expansion and the purchase of equipment and machinery; land development and interim construction loans for builders; and owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans.

By offering certificates of deposit, interest checking accounts, savings accounts and overdraft protection at competitive rates, the Company gives its depositors a full range of traditional deposit products.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s trust department maintained total assets of $2.4\u00a0billion, including managed assets of $2.1\u00a0billion. The trust department provides trust services in the Company\u2019s various market areas.  Business Strategies  The Company\u2019s main objective is to increase deposits and loans through internal growth, as well as through acquisition opportunities, while maintaining efficiency, individualized customer service and maximizing profitability. To achieve this objective, the Company has employed the following strategic goals:  Continue Community Banking Emphasis. Although the Company has significantly grown in the last several years, it intends to continue operating as a community banking organization focused on meeting the specific needs of consumers and businesses in its market areas. The Company provides a high degree of responsiveness combined with a wide variety of banking products and services. The Company staffs its banking centers with experienced bankers who possess lending expertise to effectively serve their community and gives them authority with centralized support to make certain pricing and credit decisions, avoiding the bureaucratic structure of larger banks. Each banking center has its own listed local business telephone number. Customers are served by a local banker with decision making authority. The Company also maintains specialty commercial lending lines of business staffed by bankers with lending expertise in the various business lines\u2014commercial middle market, energy, mortgage warehouse and insurance lending.  Expand Market Share Through Internal Growth and a Disciplined Acquisition Strategy. The Company intends to continue seeking opportunities, both inside and outside its existing markets, to expand either by acquiring existing banks or branches of banks or by establishing new banking centers. All of the Company\u2019s acquisitions have been accretive to earnings within 12 months after acquisition date and generally have supplied the Company with relatively low-cost deposits which have been used to fund the Company\u2019s lending and investing activities. However, future acquisitions, if any, may not be accretive to earnings within any particular time period. Factors used by the Company to evaluate expansion opportunities include (1)\u00a0the similarity in management and operating philosophies, (2)\u00a0whether the acquisition will be accretive to earnings and enhance shareholder value, (3)\u00a0whether the acquisition will strategically expand the Company\u2019s geographic footprint and (4)\u00a0the opportunity to enhance the Company\u2019s market presence in existing market areas.  Increase Loan Volume and Diversify Loan Portfolio. While maintaining its prudent approach to lending, the Company has emphasized both new and existing loan products, focusing on increasing its commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and residential real estate loan portfolios.\u00a0\u00a0Loans at December 31, 2021, were $18.62 billion compared with $20.25 billion at December 31, 2020. Commercial and industrial loans (including PPP loans) were $2.71 billion and represented 14.6% of the total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial real estate loans (including multifamily residential) were $5.25\u00a0billion and represented 28.2% of the total portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021. One-to-four-family residential loans were $4.86\u00a0billion and represented 26.1% of the total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021. Construction, land development and other land loans were $2.30\u00a0billion and represented 12.4% of the total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021. Warehouse Purchase Program loans were $1.78\u00a0billion and represented 9.5% of the total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0  Maintain Sound Asset Quality. The Company continues to maintain the sound asset quality that has been representative of its historical loan portfolio. As the Company continues to diversify and increase its lending activities and acquire loans in acquisitions, it may face higher risks of nonpayment and increased risks in the event of prolonged economic downturns. The Company intends to continue to employ the strict underwriting guidelines and comprehensive loan review process that have contributed to its low incidence of nonperforming assets and minimal charge-offs in relation to its size. Nonperforming assets were 0.15% of total loans and other real estate at December\u00a031, 2021. Excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, nonperforming assets were 0.17% of total  4  ---  loans and other real estate at December\u00a031, 2021. All Warehouse Purchase Program loans were performing loans at December\u00a031, 2021.  Continue Focus on Efficiency. The Company plans to maintain its stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has invested significantly in the infrastructure required to centralize many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan and deposit processing. For its banking centers, which the Company operates as independent profit centers, the Company supplies complete support in the areas of loan review, appraisals, loan and deposit processing, internal audit, compliance and training. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate additional growth while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through economies of scale.  Enhance Cross-Selling. The Company uses incentives and friendly competition to encourage cross-selling efforts and increase cross-selling results among its associates. Officers and associates have access to each customer\u2019s existing and related account relationships and are better able to inform customers of additional products when customers visit or call the various banking centers or use their drive-in facilities. In addition, the Company includes product information on its web page and in monthly statements and other mailings.  Competition  The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of the Company depends principally on its ability to compete in its market areas. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based nonbank lenders and certain other nonfinancial entities, including retail stores that may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations that may offer more favorable financing than the Company. The Company believes it has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service, technology and responsive decision-making with respect to loans, by establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty and by providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers.  Supervision and Regulation  The supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of the bank holding company\u2019s shareholders or creditors. The banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations.  The following description summarizes some of the laws to which the Company and the Bank are subject. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.  The Company  The Company is a financial holding company pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHCA\u201d). Accordingly, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d). The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the BHCA and other federal laws subject financial and bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Further, since the Company has securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, it is also subject to the supervision and regulation of these organizations.  Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases. The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company\u2019s revenues is dividends received from the Bank. As described in more detail below, federal and state law places limitations on the amount that banks may pay in dividends, which the Bank must adhere to when paying dividends to the Company. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected capital needs and financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company\u2019s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to limit or prohibit the payment of dividends if, in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of a bank holding company\u2019s financial condition. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure.  5  ---  In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  Source of Strength.\u00a0 Federal Reserve Board policy and federal law require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries.\u00a0Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including support at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary.  In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and is required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution. Any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.  Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies generally may not acquire a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and may not engage in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, except that it may engage in, directly or indirectly, certain activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers and permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act defines \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d to include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. Generally, no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company, such as the Company, to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company\u2019s financial holding company status depends upon it maintaining its status as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, it may not acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of the holding company\u2019s depository institutions and/or its non-bank subsidiaries if the deficiencies persist.  While the Federal Reserve Board is the \u201cumbrella\u201d regulator for financial holding companies and has the power to examine banking organizations engaged in new activities, regulation and supervision of activities which are financial in nature or determined to be incidental to such financial activities will be handled along functional lines. Accordingly, activities of subsidiaries of a financial holding company will be regulated by the agency or authorities with the most experience regulating that activity as it is conducted in a financial holding company.  Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company\u2019s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.  6  ---  The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be in excess of $1.0 million for each day the activity continues.  Anti-Tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates.  Basel III Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Company and the Bank are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d). The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratio calculations and also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator.  The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) of 2.5%, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (1)\u00a0CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%, (2)\u00a0Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.5%, (3)\u00a0total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of\u00a010.5% and (4)\u00a0Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the \u201cleverage ratio\u201d) of 4.0%. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 15.10%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.10%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.45% and Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets was 9.62%.  Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account, as detailed above, will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income\u201d (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).  With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revised the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations as discussed below under \u201cThe Bank\u2014Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies.\u201d  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations that implement ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2013 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d (\u201cCECL\u201d) in 2020 to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years. This two-year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available. The Company adopted the option provided by the interim final rule, which delayed the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital through 2021, after which the effects will be phased in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period include both the initial impact of the Company\u2019s adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ending December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments will be phased in over a three-year transition period, with 75% recognized in 2022, 50% recognized in 2023, and 25% recognized in 2024.  The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories,\u00a0depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.  The federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based and leverage capital ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.  Liquidity Requirements.\u00a0 The Basel III liquidity framework requires some banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity\u2019s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. Neither the LCR rule nor the NSFR rule apply to the Company and the Bank.  7  ---  Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary\u2019s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution\u2019s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.  The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution\u2019s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be \u201cadequately capitalized.\u201d The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes \u201csignificantly\u201d or \u201ccritically\u201d undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed dividends or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.  Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors.  Control Acquisitions. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Company. In addition, a person may not acquire 25% (5% in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company\u2019s or bank\u2019s voting securities, or otherwise obtain control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  In January 2020, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that clarifies the framework for when a company controls a bank holding company or bank under the BHCA. In particular, the final rule sets forth tiered presumptions of control in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s regulations. Under the BHCA, a company controls a bank holding company if it controls 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. A company that controls less than 5 percent of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company is presumed not to control the bank holding company. In instances in which a company owns at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent, the Federal Reserve Board considers the full facts and circumstances of the relationship between the company and the bank holding company to determine whether the company controls the bank holding company. As part of its determination as to control, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, level of ownership of voting and non-voting securities, board representation, business relationships, senior management interlocks, contractual limits on major operational or policy decisions, proxies on issues, threats to dispose of securities, and management agreements. The rule also provides several additional examples of presumptions of control and noncontrol, along with various ancillary provisions such as definitions of terms used in the presumptions.  The Volcker Rule.\u00a0The Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds. Since neither the Company nor the Bank engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on the operations of the Company or the Bank.  The Bank  The Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the DIF of the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Such supervision and regulation subject the Bank to special restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Because the Federal Reserve Board regulates the Company, the Federal Reserve Board also has supervisory authority which affects the Bank. Further, because the Bank has total assets of over $10 billion, the Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). The CFPB regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under the federal consumer financial laws.  8  ---  Equivalence to National Bank Powers. The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) has operated to limit this authority. FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the DIF. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.  Financial Modernization. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a national bank may establish a financial subsidiary and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating of satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include divestiture of the financial-in-nature subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better.  Although the powers of state chartered banks are not specifically addressed in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Texas-chartered banks such as the Bank, will have the same if not greater powers as national banks through the parity provision contained in the Texas Constitution.  Branching.\u00a0Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are permitted to engage in de\u00a0novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state, subject to applicable regulatory review and approval requirements.\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act also modified certain regulatory requirements for interstate mergers and acquisitions, including that the acquiring bank must be well capitalized and well managed. Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas or any other state, subject to federal law requirements, provided that the branch is approved in advance by the Texas Department of Banking. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers.  Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking affiliates, including the Company, are subject to Section\u00a023A and Section\u00a023B of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section\u00a023A imposes limits on the amount of such transactions to 10% of the Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus and requires that such transactions be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Section\u00a023B generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons.  Loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as \u201cinsiders\u201d) are subject to restrictions contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O, which apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.  Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of the Company\u2019s operating funds, and it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to the Company will continue to be the Company\u2019s principal source of operating funds. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank will be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d The FDIC may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. The Bank is also subject to limitations on the payment of dividends under Texas law. Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as the Company) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.  Consumer Financial Protection. The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the  9  ---  Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights and civil money penalties in each jurisdiction in which the Bank operates. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in the Bank\u2019s failure to obtain any required regulatory approval for merger or other acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.  The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater and other providers of consumer financial products or services. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of federal consumer financial laws, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate federal consumer financial laws and may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial laws in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction.  Customer Information Security. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, nonpublic customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bank has adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements.  Examinations. The FDIC periodically examines and evaluates state non-member banks, such as the Bank. The Texas Department of Banking also conducts examinations of Texas-chartered banks, but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. Additionally, the FDIC and Texas Department of Banking may elect to conduct a joint examination. Because the Bank has total assets of over $10 billion, the CFPB also has examination authority with respect to the Bank\u2019s compliance with federal consumer protection laws.  Capital Adequacy Requirements. The FDIC has adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of insured institutions. The FDIC may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk.  The FDIC\u2019s risk-based capital guidelines generally require state banks to have minimum ratios of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. The capital categories have the same definitions for the Bank as for the Company. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank\u2019s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 15.03%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets was 15.03% and total capital to total risk-weighted assets was 15.39%.  The FDIC\u2019s leverage guidelines require state banks to maintain Tier 1 capital of no less than 4.0% of average total assets. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank\u2019s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (leverage ratio) was\u00a09.58%.  Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | \u2022 | A bank is \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | \u2022 | A bank is \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or higher; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher; and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank. |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | \u2022 | A bank is \u201cundercapitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%; a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. |  10  ---  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | \u2022 | A bank is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than\u00a03.0%. |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | \u2022 | A bank is \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d if it has a tangible equity ratio to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. |  At December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank was classified as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for purposes of the FDIC\u2019s prompt corrective action regulations in effect as of such date.  In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.  As an institution\u2019s capital decreases, the FDIC\u2019s enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The FDIC has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator.  Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital.  In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank\u2019s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. In December 2020, the FDIC finalized a rule that is intended to bring the brokered deposits regulations in line with modern deposit taking methods, and that may reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered.  Deposit Insurance Assessments. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF, and the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. A depository institution\u2019s DIF assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by the assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the depository institution. The initial base assessment rate is based on its capital level and CAMELS ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and, in some cases, additional discretionary adjustments by the FDIC to reflect additional risk factors.  On June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\u201cPPPLF\u201d) and Money Market Mutual Liquidity Fund (\u201cMMLF\u201d). Pursuant to the final rule, the FDIC will generally remove the effect of PPP lending in calculating an institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment. The final rule also provides an offset to an institution's total assessment amount for the increase in its assessment base attributable to participation in the PPP and MMLF.  On February 16, 2021, the FDIC adopted a final rule to address the temporary deposit insurance assessment effects resulting from the optional regulatory capital transition provisions related to the CECL implementation. The final rule removed the double counting of a portion of the CECL transition amounts in certain financial measures that are used to determine deposit insurance assessment rates for large or highly complex insured depository institutions.  Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or \u201cswipe\u201d fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Bank and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer\u2019s debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer at least two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product.  11  ---  Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1)\u00a0total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2)\u00a0total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36\u00a0months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.  Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d) and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank\u2019s CRA record when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (\u201cFIRREA\u201d) requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank\u2019s performance under the CRA. In the case of a financial holding company or a bank holding company, the CRA performance records of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction.  In December 2019, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) jointly proposed rules that would significantly change existing CRA regulations. The proposed rules are intended to increase bank activity in low- and moderate-income communities where there is significant need for credit, more responsible lending, greater access to banking services, and improvements to critical infrastructure. The proposals change four key areas: (i) clarifying what activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updating where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) providing a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) revising CRA-related data collection, record keeping, and reporting. However, the Federal Reserve Board did not join the proposed rulemaking. In June 2020, the OCC issued its final CRA rule, effective October 1, 2020, which was later rescinded in December 2021. The FDIC has not finalized the revisions to its CRA rule. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that invited public comment on an approach to modernize the CRA regulations Accordingly, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA and their impact to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity, which cannot be predicted at this time.  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued, and in some cases proposed, a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. The regulations also impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution and could block or substantially delay a merger or other acquisition transaction.  The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (\u201cBSA\u201d), was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.  12  ---  Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the \u201cOFAC\u201d rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (1)\u00a0restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on \u201cU.S.\u00a0persons\u201d engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2)\u00a0a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S.\u00a0jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including substantial delay or blocking of a merger or other acquisition transaction.  Incentive Compensation. In June\u00a02010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (1)\u00a0provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (2)\u00a0be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3)\u00a0be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s Board of Directors.  These three principles are incorporated into the proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified covered institutions released in May 2016 by a number of federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC and SEC.\u00a0\u00a0The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered institutions, including the Company and the Bank, that have at least $1 billion in total assets, which would include (1)\u00a0prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (2)\u00a0prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (3)\u00a0establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (4)\u00a0requiring Board of Director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (5)\u00a0mandating appropriate record-keeping. Under the proposed rule, larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion would also be subject to additional requirements.  The Federal Reserve Board and FDIC review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.  Cybersecurity. In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations.  The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If the Company fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, the Company could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.  In November 2021, the federal banking agencies adopted a Final Rule, with compliance required by May 1, 2022, that requires banking organizations to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States.  13  ---  State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs, and many states, including Texas, have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. The Company expects this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which its customers are located.  Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers.  Legislative and Regulatory Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy, to businesses, and to the lives of individuals. There have been a number of regulatory actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers, including several mandates from the bank regulatory agencies, requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time. The longer-term potential impact on the Company\u2019s business could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by regulatory authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and its economic impact. Furthermore, the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period as the potential exists for additional variants of COVID-19, including the recent Omicron variant, to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of, and response to, COVID-19.  The CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, was intended to provide relief in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several provisions within the CARES Act led to action from the bank regulatory agencies and other provisions within the legislation that directly impacted financial institutions. These regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded, extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continue.  The bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue assisting those borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, on April 3, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers\u2019 ability to place consumers in short-term payment forbearance programs. This policy statement was followed by a final rule, on June\u00a023, 2020, that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Also, on September 29, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a rule that deferred appraisal and evaluation requirements after the closing of certain residential and commercial real estate transactions through December 31, 2020. Further, on December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law, which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions.  The PPP, originally established under the CARES Act and extended under the CAA, authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations as described under the section captioned \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above.  Also, the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the Department of the Treasury, has established many financing and liquidity programs. The MSLP is intended to keep credit flowing to small and mid-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the COVID-19 pandemic but now need financing to maintain operations. The PPPLF supplies liquidity to PPP participating financial institutions through term financing backed by PPP loans and the MMLF is intended to assist money market funds in meeting demands for redemptions by households and other investors, enhancing overall market functioning and credit provision to the broader economy.  Further, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued several interim final rules throughout the course of 2020 to neutralize the regulatory capital and liquidity effects for banks that participate in the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities. The interim final rule issued on April 9, 2020, clarifies that a zero percent risk weight applies to loans covered by the PPP for capital purposes and the interim final rule issued on May 15, 2020, permits depository institutions to choose to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. These interim final rules were finalized on September 29, 2020.  14  ---  Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives  From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Effect on Economic Environment  The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits; and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.  Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted.",

            "text": "General  Commerce Bancshares, Inc., a bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, was incorporated under the laws of Missouri on August 4, 1966. Through a second tier wholly-owned bank holding company, it owns all the outstanding capital stock of Commerce Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), which is headquartered in Missouri. The Bank engages in general banking business, providing a broad range of retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to individuals and businesses. Commerce Bancshares, Inc. also owns, directly or through the Bank, various non-banking subsidiaries. Their activities include private equity investment, securities brokerage, insurance agency, specialty lending, and leasing activities. A list of Commerce Bancshares, Inc.'s subsidiaries is included as Exhibit 21.  Commerce Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\") is one of the nation\u2019s top 50 bank holding companies, based on asset size. At December\u00a031, 2020, the Company had consolidated assets of $32.9 billion, loans of $16.4 billion, deposits of $26.9 billion, and equity of $3.4 billion. The Company\u2019s operations are consolidated for purposes of preparing the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The Company's principal markets, which are served by 157 branch facilities, are located throughout Missouri, Kansas, and central Illinois, as well as Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado. Its two largest markets are St. Louis and Kansas City, which serve as central hubs for the Company. The Company also has offices supporting its commercial customers in Dallas, Houston, Cincinnati, Nashville, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids, and operates a commercial payments business with sales representatives covering the continental United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d).  The Company\u2019s goal is to be the preferred provider of financial services in its communities, based on strong customer relationships built through providing top quality service with a strong risk management culture, and employing a strong balance sheet with strong capital levels. The Company operates under a super-community banking format which incorporates large bank product offerings coupled with deep local market knowledge, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select, critical areas. The Company\u2019s focus on local markets is supported by an experienced team of bankers assigned to each market coupled with industry specialists. The Company also uses regional advisory boards, comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives, who assist the Company in responding to local banking needs. In addition to this local market, community-based focus, the Company offers sophisticated financial products usually only available at much larger financial institutions.  The markets the Bank serves are mainly located in the lower Midwest, which provides natural sites for production and distribution facilities and serve as transportation hubs. The economy has been well-diversified in these markets with many major industries represented, including telecommunications, automobile, technology, financial services, aircraft and general manufacturing, health care, numerous service industries, and food and agricultural production. The personal real estate lending operations of the Bank are predominantly centered in its lower Midwestern markets.  From time to time, the Company evaluates the potential acquisition of various financial institutions. In addition, the Company regularly considers the purchase and disposition of real estate assets and branch locations. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and either possess significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company has not completed any bank acquisitions since 2013.  Employees and Human Capital  The Company employed 4,404 persons on a full-time basis and 184 persons on a part-time basis at December\u00a031, 2020. None of the Company's employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  Attracting and retaining talented team members is key to the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy and compete effectively. The Company values the unique combination of talents and experiences each team member contributes toward the Company\u2019s success and strives to offer rewards that meet team members\u2019 individual, evolving needs. Well-being is much more than a paycheck and that\u2019s why the Company takes a comprehensive approach to Total Rewards, supporting team members\u2019 physical well-being, financial well-being, and emotional well-being and career development. The Company\u2019s financial well-being program includes a company-matching 401(k) plan and health savings accounts, educational and adoption assistance programs. Emotional well-being programs include paid time off, an employee assistance program (EAP) and company-paid membership to Care.com. Physical well-being is supported by the Company\u2019s health, dental, vision, life and various other insurances, and a wellness program that incentivizes team members to live a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Career development is also a key component of the Company\u2019s Total Rewards, and the Company has a variety of programs to support team  3  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  members as they continue to grow within their current role or develop for their next role. Job shadowing, leadership development programs, Aspiring Managers program, Managing at Commerce, competency assessments and education assistance are just a few of the ways the Company helps team members excel.  During 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created new challenges for the Company and for its team members. The Company focused efforts on providing team members support and resources to navigate the unprecedented environment. Initiatives included daily communications providing relevant updates and information, resources for leaders to help keep their teams engaged and connected, new resources for working parents, and access to emotional support resources. The Company also provided premium pay to team members who were required to work onsite and 5 additional paid days off to team members experiencing COVID-19 related issues.  The Company believes diversity, equity, and inclusion builds stronger companies with better results. In 2020, the Company formalized and extended its commitment to focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by elevating initiatives in this area as strategic priorities, also known as \u201cblue chips\". The Company\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion focuses on four core pillars \u2013 people, customers, vendors, and community \u2013 while building on the foundation it has already established. The Company has launched a variety of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to support its diverse workforce. RISE (empowering women), EMERGE (connecting young professionals), VIBE (valuing multicultural perspectives), and PRIDE (engaging the LGBTQIA+ community) are important forums that provide team members opportunities to connect, learn, and encourage diverse perspectives. Other internal DEI efforts have included unconscious bias training, book clubs, listen, talk, and learn sessions, courageous conversation training, mentoring programs, and review of talent at all levels of the organization. The Company\u2019s longstanding approach of \u201cdoing what\u2019s right\u201d continues to guide its focus on its team members and communities.  The Company\u2019s robust listening strategy allows it to stay connected to the team member experience to understand the evolving needs of its team members and to focus on what matters most to them. This strategy includes a balance of surveys, focus groups, and one on one conversations to allow for two-way conversation and provides trends over time by key demographics. The Company\u2019s goal is to create a sense of belonging which it believes is connected to high levels of engagement, enablement, retention, and results. The Company\u2019s intentional strategy has allowed it to maintain levels of engagement that have been recognized by its annual survey partner, Korn Ferry, for being \u201cbest-in-class\u201d.  Competition  The Company operates in the highly competitive environment of financial services. The Company regularly faces competition from banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, credit card companies, private equity firms, leasing companies, securities brokers and dealers, financial technology companies, e-commerce companies, mutual fund companies, and other companies providing financial services. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Some other competitors are significantly larger than the Company, and therefore have greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, higher lending limits, and may offer products and services that the Company does not provide. The Company competes by providing a broad offering of products and services to support the needs of customers, matched with a strong commitment to customer service. The Company also competes based on quality, innovation, convenience, reputation, industry knowledge, and price. In its two largest markets, the Company has approximately 12% of the deposit market share in Kansas City and approximately 8% of the deposit market share in St. Louis.  Operating Segments  The Company is managed in three operating segments: Commercial, Consumer, and Wealth. The Commercial segment provides a full array of corporate lending, merchant and commercial bank card products, payment solutions, leasing, and international services, as well as business and government deposit, investment, and cash management services. The Consumer segment includes the retail branch network, consumer installment lending, personal mortgage banking, and consumer debit and credit bank card activities. The Wealth segment provides traditional trust and estate planning services, brokerage services, and advisory and discretionary investment portfolio management services to both personal and institutional corporate customers. In 2020, the Commercial, Consumer and Wealth segments contributed 52%, 25% and 22% of total segment pre-tax income, respectively. See the section captioned \"Operating Segments\" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this report and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on operating segments.  Government Policies  The Company's operations are affected by federal and state legislative changes, by the United States government, and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the numerous states in which they operate. These include, for example, the statutory minimum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal  4  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  Reserve System, United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary policies, the U.S. Patriot Act, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state bank regulatory agencies.  Supervision and Regulation  The following information summarizes existing laws and regulations that materially affect the Company's operations. It does not discuss all provisions of these laws and regulations, and it does not include all laws and regulations that affect the Company presently or may affect the Company in the future.  General  The Company, as a bank holding company, is primarily regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s prior approval is required in any case in which the Company proposes to acquire all or substantially all the assets of any bank, acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. With certain exceptions, the BHC Act also prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any non-banking company. Under the BHC Act, the Company may not engage in any business other than managing and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services to subsidiaries, and may not acquire voting control of non-banking companies unless the Federal Reserve Board determines such businesses and services to be closely related to banking. When reviewing bank acquisition applications for approval, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA). Under the terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income areas. The Bank has a current CRA rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d  The Company is required to file various reports and additional information with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regularly performs examinations of the Company. The Bank is a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Missouri Division of Finance. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In addition, there are numerous other federal and state laws and regulations which control the activities of the Company, including requirements and limitations relating to capital and reserve requirements, permissible investments and lines of business, transactions with affiliates, loan limits, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of securities, dividend payments, and extensions of credit. The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws designed to protect customers and promote fair lending. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts. If the Company fails to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, it may be subject to civil monetary penalties, imposition of cease and desist orders or other written directives, removal of management and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the preservation of the federal deposit insurance funds. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company\u2019s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to employ assets and maximize income.  In addition to its regulatory powers, the Federal Reserve Bank affects the conditions under which the Company operates by its influence over the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. government securities and oversees changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, changes in the federal funds rate on overnight inter-bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits in implementing its monetary policy objectives. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits, the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and the level of inflation. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions, most notably on the interest rate environment. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company makes no prediction as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand, or their effect on the financial statements of the Company.  The financial industry operates under laws and regulations that are under regular review by various agencies and legislatures and are subject to change. The Company currently operates as a bank holding company, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and the Bank qualifies as a financial subsidiary under the GLB Act, which allows it to engage in investment banking, insurance agency, brokerage, and underwriting activities that were not available to banks prior to the GLB Act. The GLB Act also included privacy provisions that limit banks\u2019 abilities to disclose non-public information about customers to non-affiliated entities.  5  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  The Company must also comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA is designed to help fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes. Compliance is monitored by the Federal Reserve. The BSA was enacted to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries for, or to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from, criminal activity. Since its passage, the BSA has been amended several times. These amendments include the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 which made money laundering a criminal act, as well as the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 which required regulators to develop enhanced examination procedures and increased examiner training to improve the identification of money laundering schemes in financial institutions.  The USA PATRIOT Act, established in 2001, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations include significant penalties for non-compliance.  The Company is subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 (Dodd-Frank Act). Among its many provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act required stress-testing for certain financial services companies and established a new council of \u201csystemic risk\u201d regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which is authorized to supervise certain financial services companies and has responsibility to implement, examine for compliance with, and enforce \u201cFederal consumer financial law.\u201d The Company is subject to examinations by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act, through Title VI, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, placed trading restrictions on financial institutions and separated investment banking, private equity and proprietary trading (hedge fund) sections of financial institutions from their consumer lending arms. The Volcker Rule also restricts financial institutions from investing in and sponsoring certain types of investments.  In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law which provides a number of limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Notable provisions of the legislation include: an increase in the asset threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion, above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards; an exemption from the Volcker Rule for insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets; modifications to the Liquidity Coverage and Supplementary Leverage ratios; and the elimination of Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests for banks and bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets. Most of these provisions affect institutions larger than the Company, and the Company is not required to prepare stress testing as specified by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Subsidiary Bank  Under Federal Reserve policy, the bank holding company, Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (the \"Parent\"), is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support it in circumstances when it might not otherwise do so. In addition, loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  Deposit Insurance  Substantially all of the deposits held by the Bank are insured up to applicable limits (generally $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category) by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.\u00a0In 2011, the FDIC released a final rule to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that affected deposit insurance assessments.\u00a0Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, removed the upper limit of the designated reserve ratio, required that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and required the FDIC to offset the effect of increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio on depository institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion.\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act provided the FDIC flexibility in the implementation of the increase in the designated reserve ratio and also required that the FDIC redefine the assessment base to average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity.  On June 30, 2016, the DIF rose above 1.15%, resulting in a reduction of the initial assessment rate for all banks and implementing a 4.5 basis point surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Effective October 1, 2018, this surcharge was eliminated as the DIF reached its required level of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. This had the effect of reducing the Company\u2019s insurance costs by $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company's deposit insurance expense was $7.8 million and $6.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the  6  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  Company's 2020 deposit insurance expense was partly due to a higher assessment rate but was primarily driven by growth in the Company's assessment base.  Payment of Dividends  The Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of cash dividends to shareholders by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The principal source of the Parent's cash revenues is cash dividends paid by the Bank. The amount of dividends paid by the Bank in any calendar year is limited to the net profit of the current year combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, and permission must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board for dividends exceeding these amounts. The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by factors such as the maintenance of adequate capital.  Capital Adequacy  The Company is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to judgments by regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors.  A comprehensive capital framework was established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which was effective for large and internationally active U.S. banks and bank holding companies on January 1, 2015. A key goal of the Basel III framework was to strengthen the capital resources of banking organizations during normal and challenging business environments. Basel III increased minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The rule includes a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer is intended to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Failure to maintain the buffer will result in constraints on dividends, stock repurchases and executive compensation. The rule also adjusted the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. At December\u00a031, 2020, the Company's capital ratios are well in excess of those minimum ratios required by Basel III.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, an insured depository institution generally will be classified as well-capitalized (under the Basel III rules mentioned above) if it has a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d or \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal bank regulator, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. The Bank has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards.  Stress Testing  As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company performed stress tests as specified by the Federal Reserve requirement and published results beginning in 2014 through 2017. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was enacted, which eliminated the required stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act for banks with consolidated assets of less than $250 billion. The Company continues to perform periodic stress-testing based on its own internal criteria.  Executive and Incentive Compensation  Guidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice, and describe compensation as \"excessive\" when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. The Federal Reserve Board has issued comprehensive  7  ---  [Table of contents](#i0176a501ab9a402fa26bd5cbfa91c261_7)  guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking. This guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, based on key principles that (i) incentives do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to identify and manage risk, (ii) compensation arrangements are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) compensation arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective board oversight. Deficiencies in compensation practices may affect supervisory ratings and enforcement actions may be taken if incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to safety and soundness.  Transactions with Affiliates  The Federal Reserve Board regulates transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries.\u00a0Generally, the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, limit the Company\u2019s banking subsidiary and its subsidiaries to lending and other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with affiliates.\u00a0The aggregate amount of covered transactions a banking subsidiary or its subsidiaries may enter into with an affiliate may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary.  Covered transactions with affiliates are also subject to collateralization requirements and must be conducted on arm\u2019s length terms.\u00a0Covered transactions include (a) a loan or extension of credit by the banking subsidiary, including derivative contracts, (b) a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary, (c) a purchase of assets by the banking subsidiary unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve, (d) acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan, and (e) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate.  Certain transactions with the Company's directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations. Among other things, these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals, and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans to related parties.

We had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2022.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For further information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d on page 38 in Management's Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  We focus on serving our customers and communities. Our experienced bankers develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs.

Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, and financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d). Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, mobile and online banking functionality and other delivery methods, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationship with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. In some cases, these regulations may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act, but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2022, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d), and in excess of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, compared with our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2022.  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 9.8 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.5 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.2 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 7.7 | |  |  Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test. Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require many banks to adhere to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) process and stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). We are not regulated by the FRB and therefore are not subject to this process. However, we use the FRB\u2019s CCAR process, including published economic scenarios, to inform our stress testing activities.  Liquidity  We manage liquidity in accordance with Basel III liquidity requirements, and we utilize internal liquidity stress tests as our primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. During the recent pandemic, our liquidity profile benefited from a significant influx of deposits, which was impacted by certain fiscal and monetary policy decisions. In 2022, with the withdrawal of such measures by the federal government, our deposit levels decreased; however, our liquidity profile remained above regulatory and internal Bank limits. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the rising interest rate environment.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal banking regulators have enacted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  State regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. During the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators. For example, in 2022, the SEC proposed new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies. If the proposed rules are adopted, they may require changes in the way such companies disclose material cybersecurity events. These evolving laws and rules will continue to have an impact on our risk management practices.  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Other Regulations  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See discussion under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by ESG interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to ESG issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, our ongoing monitoring enables us to enhance our business practices by incorporating ESG recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities. In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s 2022 proposed rule on climate-related disclosures, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address ESG issues. These laws may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations and may increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address ESG issues. The report is available on our website.  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices. This system includes frameworks, policies, and guidelines such as the following:  \u2022Corporate Governance Guidelines;  \u2022A Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees;  \u2022A Director's Code of Conduct;  \u2022A Risk Management Framework;  \u2022A Related Party Transaction Policy;  \u2022A Compensation Clawback Policy;  \u2022Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines;  \u2022An Insider Trading Policy, including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders; and  \u2022Charters for our Executive, Audit, Risk Oversight, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.  More information on our corporate governance practices is available on our website at zionsbancorporation.com. Our website is not part of this Form 10-K.  HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  We are proud of our employees who bring their unique, diverse talents to work each day. We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.  The recent COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on how and where we work. We were successful in transitioning most of our employees to working remotely, and as the pandemic subsided and related treatments improved, we returned to more in-person collaboration while supporting certain flexible and remote work arrangements. We believe that in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture.  During 2022, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more options with health care plans, and greater access to mental health benefits.  We had 9,989 full-time equivalent employees December\u00a031, 2022. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our employees.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Schedule 2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | | | Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | Management | | | 52% | | |  | | | 28% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | Non-management | | | 61% | | |  | | | 39% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | Overall | | | 59% | | |  | | | 37% | | |  | | | 12% | | |  | | | 2% | | |  The following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:  Cultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate  We believe in an environment where people are respected and valued, and where individual and cultural differences are embraced. We also believe that our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  We have instituted enterprise-wide and affiliate diversity, equity, and inclusion councils; employee business forums; regional inclusion champions; mental health initiatives; and a broad range of employee and community events. Throughout the organization, employee business resource groups foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through forum meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and initiatives that support our commitment to diversity, both internally and externally.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  We offer more than 2,000 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2022, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the increasing competition for talent in the labor market. We experienced greater challenges in the recent past in filling certain job openings relative to when labor market conditions were more balanced, but we began to see improvement in 2022. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ibed05370d5ca421b99c171e306c00bca_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We value work-life balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental, physical, social, and financial wellness. Some of our key benefits include the following:  \u2022Corporate match for our 401(k) plan of 4.5% of an employee\u2019s salary and incentive compensation;  \u2022Annual profit-sharing contributions;  \u2022Health care plan options including behavioral health, wellness, and autism spectrum disorder services;  \u2022Expanded mental health coverage, including coaching and clinical therapy sessions;  \u2022Preventive prescription drug coverage not subject to deductibles;  \u2022Paid parental leave program;  \u2022Adoption assistance program; and  \u2022Paid time off for various community service activities and other volunteer opportunities.",

COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for  13  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We value work-life balance and strive to create a work environment that supports our employees with mental, physical, social, and financial wellness. Some of our key benefits include the following:  \u2022Corporate match for our 401(k) plan of 4.5% of an employee\u2019s salary and incentive compensation;  \u2022Annual profit-sharing contributions;  \u2022Health care plan options including behavioral health, wellness, and autism spectrum disorder services;  \u2022Expanded mental health coverage, including coaching and clinical therapy sessions;  \u2022Preventive prescription drug coverage not subject to deductibles;  \u2022Paid parental leave program;  \u2022Adoption assistance program; and  \u2022Paid time off for various community service activities and other volunteer opportunities.",

We provide a wide range of banking products and related services, primarily in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We had more than one million customers at year-end 2023, served by 407 branches and various online, mobile, and digital offerings. We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023.  We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed and geographically defined bank divisions, which we refer to as \u201caffiliates,\u201d or \u201caffiliate banks,\u201d each with its own local branding and management team. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments as referred to throughout this document. We emphasize local authority, responsibility, pricing, and customization of certain products that are designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the \u201cOther\u201d segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. For more information about our segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) on page 42 and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  We focus on serving customers in the communities in which we operate. Our experienced bankers strive to develop long-lasting relationships with our customers by providing competitive products and award-winning service. Building and sustaining these relationships is essential to understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Some of the products and services we provide, whether delivered digitally or by other means, include:  \u2022Commercial and small business banking. We serve a wide range of commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses. Products and services we provide to our commercial and small business banking customers include:  \u25e6Commercial and industrial and owner-occupied lending and leasing;  \u25e6Municipal and public finance services;  \u25e6Depository account and cash management services;  5  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u25e6Commercial and small business cards, as well as merchant processing services;  \u25e6Corporate trust services; and  \u25e6Correspondent banking and international lending services.  \u2022Capital markets and investment banking. We provide customized financing solutions to help our customers raise capital efficiently, execute strategic transactions, and manage exposure to financial markets. Capital markets products and services include:  \u25e6Loan syndications;  \u25e6Foreign exchange services and interest rate derivatives;  \u25e6Fixed income securities underwriting;  \u25e6Advisory and capital raising;  \u25e6Commercial mortgage-backed security (\u201cCMBS\u201d) conduit lending; and  \u25e6Power and project financing.  \u2022Commercial real estate lending. We provide lending products secured by commercial real estate to borrowers that include:  \u25e6Term and construction/land development financing, including the following collateral types:  \u25aaCommercial multi-family, industrial, and office; and  \u25aaResidential single-family, community development, and affordable housing.  \u2022Retail banking.

Additional offerings to our wealth management customers include:  \u25e6Investment management services;  \u25e6Fiduciary and estate services; and  \u25e6Advanced business succession and estate planning services.  COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our most direct competition for loans, deposits, and other banking services generally comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d), and private credit or debt funds. Some of these financial institutions do not have a physical presence in our market footprint, but solicit business via the internet and other means. We also compete with finance companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, other nontraditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, greater ability to develop, implement, and offer technologies and other innovative financial services, and lower-cost structures, taxes, and regulatory burdens.  Our key differentiators include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of branch and office locations, a wide range of products and services offered, and the overall relationships with our customers. We strive to compete effectively in all of these areas to remain successful.  6  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended to promote the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, depositors, and communities. Although banks and their customers benefit from many of these regulations, in some cases, they may not be aligned with, or intended to protect, the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Banking laws and regulations have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced, and may continue to reduce, returns earned by shareholders. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results.  General  We are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). We, as well as some of our subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and state securities regulators.  The National Bank Act  Our corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, we are not subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), but are subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. Our common stock and certain other securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to national banks, though we continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory frameworks are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to many other publicly held companies.  The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. The OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. Our common stock has a par value of $0.001. In addition, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level.  Capital Standards \u2013 Basel Framework  At December\u00a031, 2023, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules, which include certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements prescribed by the OCC. The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and other factors, such as risk weights, affecting banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III capital rules require us to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, as well as a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d). Financial institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d which is defined as four quarters of trailing net income, net of distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. For more information about our capital ratios, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in MD&A on page 72.  7  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Prompt Corrective Action  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve identified problems of insured depository institutions, including, but not limited to, those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution will generally be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. An insured depository institution will generally be classified as under-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier\u00a01 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4%.  An institution that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under-capitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, interest rates paid on deposits, the acceptance of brokered deposits, and restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulator.  The following schedule presents minimum capital ratio and capital conservation buffer requirements, our capital ratios at December\u00a031, 2023, and the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized:  Schedule 1  MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | Minimum requirement to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d | | | |  | | | Minimum capital requirement | | | Capital conservation buffer | | | Minimum capital ratio requirement with capital conservation buffer | | |  | | | Current capital  ratio | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | CET1 to risk-weighted assets | | | 4.5 | | % | 2.5 | | % | 7.0 | | % |  | | | 10.3 | | % | 6.5 | | % | | Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 6.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 8.5 | |  |  | | | 10.9 | |  | 8.0 | |  | | Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets | | | 8.0 | |  | 2.5 | |  | 10.5 | |  |  | | | 12.8 | |  | 10.0 | |  | | Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the \u201cTier 1 leverage ratio\u201d) | | | 4.0 | |  | N/A | | | 4.0 | |  |  | | | 8.3 | |  | 5.0 | |  |  Recent Regulatory Developments  Basel III Endgame  On July 27, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cBasel III Endgame,\u201d would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposal is subject to a three-year phase-in period for certain aspects of the proposal, and would be effective beginning July 1, 2025. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had $87.2 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We are evaluating the potential future impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.  8  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Under the proposal, if at such time we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would, among other things, be required to (1) include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in regulatory capital and be subject to increased limitations on deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) as a percent of CET1, (2) hold capital for operational risk and market risk, and (3) calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach.  Long-term Debt  On August 29, 2023, bank regulators issued a proposal that would expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or more. The proposed rule would require these banks to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is the greatest of (1) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (2) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (3) 3.5% of average total assets. In the event we were to increase our total assets to $100 billion or more, we would have a three-year implementation period to issue debt and meet the other requirements under the proposal. At December\u00a031, 2023, if enacted as proposed, the estimated amount of incremental debt that would be implied by the proposal (based on our asset size at year end) would be approximately $3.5 billion over the three year phase-in period. We expect that the issuance of incremental debt would replace other sources of funding.  Resolution Planning  Additionally, on August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would revise the requirements for resolution planning (\u201cliving wills\u201d) for banks in two asset categories. Under the proposal, banks with total assets of $100 billion or more would be required to submit more detailed living wills, while banks with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would submit more limited information filings, in each case filed biennially beginning in 2025.  FDIC Special Assessment  In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment pursuant to a systemic risk determination to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early 2023. Using an assessment base equal to the estimated amount of uninsured deposits above $5 billion at December\u00a031, 2022, the FDIC is expected to collect the special assessment from banks at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. At December\u00a031, 2023, our estimated impact of the special assessment was approximately $90 million, which we recorded in deposit insurance and regulatory expense during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Capital Planning and Stress Testing  We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, which are comparable in severity to the scenarios published by the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d). Our recent internal stress test included hypothetical scenarios that reflected (1) high inflation, (2) increased losses on commercial loans due to inflation and supply chain disruptions, (3) declining commercial property values, (4) increased losses on consumer loans due to falling home prices, (5) rising unemployment, and (6) other current economic, financial, and social disruptions. The results of our stress test indicated that we would maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimum and capital conservation buffer requirements throughout the nine-quarter horizon for the hypothetical stress test.  Liquidity  We utilize internal liquidity stress tests as a primary tool for establishing and managing liquidity guidelines including, but not limited to, holdings of investment securities and other liquid assets, levels of readily available contingency funding, concentrations of funding sources, and the maturity profile of liabilities. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities. We continue to actively manage our deposit base and associated deposit costs in response to the higher interest rate environment. For more information about our liquidity profile, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in MD&A on page 67.  9  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity  The federal legislature and federal banking regulators have implemented laws and rules governing the use of consumer information by banks and other financial institutions, including provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties, require financial institutions to disclose privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These laws and regulations also affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.  Federal and state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For example, recently effective SEC rules now require timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and description of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Additionally, during the past several years, a growing number of states, including those in which we conduct business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws and regulations granting consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over personal information, establishing or modifying data breach notification requirements, and requiring certain financial institutions to implement detailed and prescriptive cybersecurity programs. Data and cybersecurity laws and regulations are evolving rapidly and remain a focus of state and federal regulators.  Other Regulations and Proposals  We are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state laws. These regulations and other proposals include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends on both our common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \u2022Safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies.  \u2022Requirements for approval of acquisitions and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of an unaffiliated nonbank. See further discussion in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.  \u2022Limits on interchange fees imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, including a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed revising Regulation II to lower debit interchange fees by almost 30% and institute a biennial review of the cap without accompanying public comment. If this proposal passes, it could reduce our fee income by approximately $10 million or more per year.  \u2022Limitations on the dollar amount of loans made to a borrower and its affiliates.  \u2022Limitations on transactions with affiliates.  \u2022Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments and ability to underwrite certain types of securities (e.g., common equity).  \u2022Requirements for opening and closing of branches.  10  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  \u2022A number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including fair lending and truth in lending requirements, to provide equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. In addition, as a bank with $10 billion or more in assets, we are subject to examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws by the CFPB, which has broad rule making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. These rules and regulations often have the effect of reducing bank revenues and returns earned by shareholders. As an example, the CFPB recently proposed extending certain truth in lending requirements to overdraft fees and placing other restrictions on various fees routinely charged by banks in exchange for providing financial services to customers.  \u2022Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. The CRA requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals. If we fail to adequately serve our communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Banking agencies recently finalized rules that completely overhaul the evaluation framework used by regulators to assess a bank\u2019s performance under and compliance with these requirements, which may make it more difficult for banks to achieve satisfactory ratings. The potential impact of these new rules on the Bank and the industry as a whole is currently under review.  \u2022Requirements regarding the time, manner, and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including requirements related to the SEC\u2019s 2022 rule on pay versus performance disclosures, and recently finalized rules regarding the clawback of executive pay in certain circumstances involving accounting restatements. These restrictions include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and the aforementioned clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or engage in certain other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.  \u2022Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA Patriot Act\u201d), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.  \u2022Tax laws of the U.S., its states, and other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Sustainability standards and related concerns, including those related to global climate change, continue to evolve and have become more prominent in recent years. We are closely monitoring developments in standards published by sustainability interest groups and organizations, as well as proposed regulatory initiatives and expectations relating to these issues. Although we believe the way we do business has been and is consistent with many of these standards and expectations, we strive to enhance our business practices by incorporating sustainability recommendations that we believe will benefit our investors, customers, employees, and communities.  In addition to proposed and evolving rulemaking by federal regulators, such as the SEC\u2019s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures and the bank regulatory agencies\u2019 recently issued principles designed to provide a framework for large financial institutions to manage exposure to climate-related financial risks, many states have adopted, or are considering, laws that address climate and social issues. For example, the state of California recently passed sweeping climate-related disclosure laws that will require large entities doing business in the state, including the Bank, to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate-related risks. These laws will increase our compliance costs and may include provisions that conflict with other state and federal regulations, or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. We publish an annual Corporate Responsibility Report that provides a summary of how we address these issues. The report is available on our website.  11  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  Corporate Governance  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has overseen management\u2019s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk management practices.

We are committed to identifying, recognizing, and creating fulfilling opportunities for our employees, and rewarding them for their contributions to our success.  During 2023, we continued to enhance certain benefits for our employees to adapt to the changing practices of the labor market. Recent changes include more flexibility with paid time off, more health care plan alternatives, and greater access to mental health benefits.  We had 9,679 full-time equivalent employees at December\u00a031, 2023. The following schedule presents certain demographic attributes of our workforce as self-identified by our employees:  Schedule 2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Women | | |  | | | People of Color | | |  | | | Disabled | | |  | | | Veterans | | | | Employee Roles | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | | Management | | | 52% | | |  | | | 29% | | |  | | | 9% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | Non-management | | | 60% | | |  | | | 40% | | |  | | | 10% | | |  | | | 2% | | | | All employees | | | 58% | | |  | | | 38% | | |  | | | 10% | | |  | | | 2% | | |  The following objectives and initiatives are integral to our human capital management efforts:  Cultivating an environment where people are respected and valued, and where individual and cultural differences are embraced  We believe that (1) our performance is stronger when we are able to draw upon the talents and experience of a diverse team of employees, and (2) in-person exchange of ideas and viewpoints, in both formal and informal settings, improves productivity and supports a strong corporate culture while still offering flexibility to balance personal needs.  12  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  We endeavor to provide opportunities for growth, development, and leadership to every employee. We are committed to continue this focus on ensuring that we have a workplace where all are treated fairly in accordance with their qualifications and abilities, and that the Bank is a place where everyone counts.  We strive to build a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structures. Our Everyone Counts Council coordinates the related efforts of our affiliates and enterprise groups, and advises executive management on goals and recommendations for ongoing improvement. Our efforts include employee business forums, mental health initiatives, and a broad range of employee and regional events. Throughout the organization, the employee business forums foster a sense of community and enable greater connectivity and support among employees through meetings and discussions, which are open to all employees and offer networking and connections to the communities in which we operate.  We use analytics, recruiting outreach efforts, and manager training to reach a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society. To identify qualified candidates, our recruiting team partners with community organizations, schools, and governmental entities that support marginalized and underserved communities in our footprint. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, highlights several achievements in this area, such as our Banker Development Program, which attracts and advances undergraduates and early career professionals.  Attracting, developing, and retaining talent for long-term success  We are committed to (1) attracting, developing, and retaining the most qualified individuals who reflect the diversity of the available workforce and markets in which we operate, (2) helping our employees grow in their careers, and (3) actively building a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities. As we attract and hire talent, we proactively consider the demand for competencies that will be needed within the workforce of the future.  Consistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities. We offer more than 1,500 virtual, in-person, expert-led, and pre-recorded or self-paced learning options for employees to create custom learning plans for personal and professional development. In 2023, we hosted more than 1,000 training experiences to support employees, build new skills, or to assist in career advancement. We offer new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, education sponsorship opportunities, job shadowing, coaching, and formal mentoring programs. Our talent development program and individual development plans focus on education, experience, and exposure to help create well-rounded, highly skilled, and successful employees.  We are also mindful of the continued competition for talent in the labor market. We continue to analyze relevant metrics related to employee recruiting and turnover, which has and will continue to impact wages and flexible work arrangements.  Recognizing, engaging, and rewarding our employees  Our comprehensive rewards and recognition programs are designed to reward high performance, improve retention, and enhance the employee experience through recognition and growth opportunities. We provide meaningful upside opportunities for those who take accountability for business objectives that help us deliver superior results while reducing risk.  We routinely assess pay equity among employees across our organization by analyzing potential disparities in pay based on gender, minority status, and other factors. These actions help us compensate employees fairly. On a biennial basis, we enlist the services of an independent third party to review our pay equity. Results of the most recent review revealed that after adjusting for relevant variables such as education, experience, performance, and geography, there were no meaningful differences in pay levels among men, women, and people of color. We remain committed to fair and equitable compensation for all our employees.  Our employees provide regular feedback through enterprise outreach and engagement forums, which include quarterly leadership calls, biannual employee opinion surveys, and targeted focus groups. These forums for  13  ---  [Table of Contents](#ia237b75d5c2d442c99605d4f101a7e76_7)  ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  employee input continue to help strengthen working relationships with managers, improve clarity of organizational purpose and goals, and reinforce our Guiding Principles and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
