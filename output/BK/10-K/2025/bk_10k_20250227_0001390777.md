BNY 1

are based upon current beliefs and expectations of future events, many of which are, by their nature, difficult to predict, outside of our control and subject to change. By identifying these statements in this manner, we are alerting investors to the possibility that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors, including those factors described in the Annual Report under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) – Risk Factors,” such as:

• errors or delays in our operational and transaction processing, or those of third parties, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation;

• our risk management framework, policies and processes may not be effective in identifying or mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk management framework, policies and processes could expose us to unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition;

• limitations of the models we use to measure, monitor and manage risk could lead to unexpected losses and adverse business impacts;

• a communications or technology disruption or failure within our infrastructure or the infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss of information, delays our ability to access information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;

• a cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our computer systems, networks and information, or those of third parties, could result in the theft, disclosure, use or alteration of information, unauthorized access to or loss of information, or system or network failures. Any such incident or failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses;

• the development and use of artificial intelligence present risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business;

• we are subject to extensive government rulemaking, policies, regulation and supervision

that impact our operations. Changes to and introduction of new rules and regulations have compelled, and in the future may compel, us to change how we manage our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;

• regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our businesses or reputation;

• our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees;

• a failure or circumvention of our controls, policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation;

• weakness and volatility in financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;

• we are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by slowing market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance and/or negative trends in savings rates or in investment preferences;

• levels of and changes in interest rates have impacted, and will in the future continue to impact, our profitability and capital levels, at times adversely;

• we have experienced, and may continue to experience, unrealized or realized losses on securities related to volatile and illiquid market conditions, reducing our capital levels and/or earnings;

• the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant clients or counterparties, many of whom are major financial institutions or sovereign entities, and our assumption of credit, counterparty and concentration risk, could expose us to credit losses and adversely affect our business;

• we could incur losses if our allowance for credit losses, including loan and lending-related commitment reserves, is inadequate or if our expectations of future economic conditions deteriorate;

2 BNY

• our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity;

• failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and financial condition;

• the Parent is a non-operating holding company and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to meet its obligations, including with respect to its securities, and to provide funds for share repurchases, payment of income taxes and payment of dividends to its stockholders;

• our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including those governing capital and capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware law and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock;

• any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A. or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the value of the securities we issue;

• the application of our Title I preferred resolution strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly liquidation authority could adversely affect the Parent’s liquidity and financial condition and the Parent’s security holders;

• new lines of business, new products and services or transformational or strategic project initiatives subject us to new or additional risks, and the failure to implement these initiatives could affect our results of operations;

• our strategic transactions present risks and uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on

our business, financial condition and results of operations;

• we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our transition to a platforms operating model;

• we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability;

• our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or other reputational harm;

• impacts from geopolitical events, acts of terrorism, war, natural disasters, the physical effects of climate change, pandemics and other similar events may have a negative impact on our business and operations;

• sustainability concerns, including a focus on climate change and diversity, could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels, subject us to additional regulatory requirements and damage our reputation;

• tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income, effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition; and

• changes in accounting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements and future events could have a material impact on our reported financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and other financial data.

Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all risk factors discussed in the Annual Report and any subsequent reports filed with the SEC by BNY pursuant to the Exchange Act. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and BNY undertakes no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

#### Human Capital Management
Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team—one that includes varying perspectives, backgrounds and experiences, and reflects the increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our core objective is to empower our teams to do their best work, make unique contributions and build purposeful careers in an environment where they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect.

Belonging

Belonging is integral to who we are as a company, what our people experience as members of our global team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders. Our strategy is not separate, it includes all of our employees and is embedded in the way we do business, our operating model, talent experience and client value proposition.

At the end of 2024, women represented 40% of BNY’s global workforce and 43% of BNY’s U.S. workforce. Further, 39% of BNY’s U.S. workforce were from U.S. underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

At the end of 2024, 43% of BNY’s Executive Committee were women and 26% of BNY’s Executive Committee were from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

At the end of 2024, 45% of our Board of Directors were women and 27% of our Board of Directors was composed of individuals from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

Retention, Training and Development

We seek to attract and retain employees by providing a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that employees seek a supportive and safe workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees and other defined contribution retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with market practice. We also maintain defined benefit plans for certain current and former employees, some of which are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec. 31, 2024, we had approximately 41,500 participants in our 401(k) plan, including former employees. In addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan

covered approximately 6,400 U.S. participants, and our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately 18,400 non-U.S. participants.

In 2024, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation again provided eligible employees an award of 10 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or “BK Shares”. BK Shares is an equity grant that allows for eligible employees to become equity owners, or increase their equity holdings in the Company, and share in the Company’s success.

At key career transition points, from internship to executive management, we offer programs and development opportunities to help employees advance their careers and progress within our organization. Our extensive training and development opportunities are designed to enable employees to grow professionally and advance within our organization.

We engage with employees to encourage innovation, show appreciation for their contributions, and gather feedback on how we can build a more rewarding, inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly gather feedback through an all-employee survey.

Employee Wellbeing, Health and Safety

BNY’s holistic approach to employee wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and vibrant workforce. Our programs are designed to provide employees access to resources to help improve their physical health, emotional resilience, financial wellbeing and social connections. Further, we work to ensure the safety of our employees and clients in all of our facilities.

BNY fosters a high-performance culture and supports employee work/life balance, while also delivering on our regulatory requirements and business imperatives. We endeavor to promote a collaborative and effective workplace for our people, while continuing to embrace the concept of flexibility and enhancing our culture and commercial impact.

Employees and International Operations

Globally, at Dec. 31, 2024, BNY and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,800 full-time employees.

We pride ourselves on providing dedicated service through our multilingual sales, marketing and client

6 BNY

service teams.

#### Supervision and Regulation
Information on the supervision and regulation of BNY can be found in the “MD&A – Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

#### Competition
BNY is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers.

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, including adaptation to technological change, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees, retain, develop and motivate our existing employees, amid heightened regulatory restrictions and an inflationary or uncertain

interest rate environment. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, such as financial technology firms, and as further technological advances enable more companies, such as financial technology firms, to provide financial services.

For additional discussion regarding competition, see “MD&A – Risk Factors – Operational Risk – Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees” and “MD&A – Risk Factors – Strategic Risk – We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
